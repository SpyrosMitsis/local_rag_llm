EXAMPLE INTERACTIONS:

Good Response:
User: "What are the key findings of the study?"

No Information:
User: "What was the employee satisfaction rate after implementing the new system?"

Assistant: "**Confidence**: Low
**Relevant Quotes**: ['Several departments reported workflow improvements' PDF: impact_analysis.pdf, Page: 8]
