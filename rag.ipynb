CONTINUOUS LATENT VARIABLES Figure 12.1 A synthetic data sel obtained by taking one of the off-line digit images and creating multi- ple copies in each of which the digit has undergone a random displacement and rotation within some larger image field. The resulting images each have 100 )( 100 = 10.000 pixels. that the manifold will be nonlinear because. for instance. if we translate the digit past a particular pixel, that pixel value will go from zero (white) 10 one (black) and back to zero again. which is clearly a nonlinear function of the digit position. In this example. !.he lranslation and rotation parameters are latent variables because we observe only the image vectors and are not told which values of the translation or rotation variables were used to create them. For real digit image data, there will be a funher degree of freedom arising from scaling. Moreover there will be multiple addilional degrees of freedom associaled wilh more complex deformations due to the variability in an individual's wriling 3S well as lhe differences in writing slyles between individuals. evenheless. the number of such degrees of freedom will be small compared to the dimensionality of Ihe data set. AppendiX A Another example is provided by the oil flow data set. in which (for a given ge- ometrical configuration of the gas, WOller, and oil phases) there are only two degrees of freedom of variability corresponding to the fraction of oil in the pipe and the frac- tion of water (the fraction of gas Ihen being determined). Ahhough the data space comprises 12 measuremenlS, a data set of points will lie close to a Iwo-dimensional manifold embedded within this space. In this case, the manifold comprises scveral distinct segments corresponding to different flow regimes. each such segment being a (noisy) continuous two-dimensional manifold. If our goal is data compression. or density modelling, then there can be benefits in exploiling this manifold struclUre. In praclice. the data points will not be confined precisely to a smooth low- dimensional manifold, and we can interpret the departures of data points from the manifold as ·noise'. This leads naturally to a generative view of such models in which we first select a poinl within the manifold according to some latent variable distribution and then generate an observed data point by :ldding noise, drawn from some conditional distribution of the data varillbles given the latent varillbles. Thc simplest continuous latent variable model assumes Gaussian distributions for both thc latent and observed variables and makes use of a linear,Gaussian de- SeCTion 8.1..J pendence of the observed variables on Ihe slate of the latent variables. This leads to a probabilislic fonnulation of the well-known technique of principal component analysis (PeA), as well as 10 a related model called factor analysis. Section 12.1 In this chapter w will begin wilh a slandard, nonprobabilistic treatment of PeA. and thcn we show how PeA arises naturally as the maximum likelihood solution 10\"},\n",

A Markov chain is called homogeneous if the transition probabilities are the same for all m. The marginal probability for a particular variable can be expressed in terms of the marginal probability for the previous variable in the chain in the form p(z(m+1)) = \\x02 z(m) p(z(m+1)|z(m))p(z(m)). (11.38) A distribution is said to be invariant, or stationary, with respect to a Markov chain if each step in the chain leaves that distribution invariant. Thus, for a homogeneous Markov chain with transition probabilities T(z′, z), the distribution p⋆(z) is invariant if p⋆(z) = \\x02 z′ T(z′, z)p⋆(z′). (11.39) Note that a given Markov chain may have more than one invariant distribution. For instance, if the transition probabilities are given by the identity transformation, then any distribution will be invariant. A sufﬁcient (but not necessary) condition for ensuring that the required distribu- tion p(z) is invariant is to choose the transition probabilities to satisfy the property of detailed balance, deﬁned by p⋆(z)T(z, z′) = p⋆(z′)T(z′, z) (11.40) for the particular distribution p⋆(z). It is easily seen that a transition probability that satisﬁes detailed balance with respect to a particular distribution will leave that distribution invariant, because \\x02 z′ p⋆(z′)T(z′, z) = \\x02 z′ p⋆(z)T(z, z′) = p⋆(z) \\x02 z′ p(z′|z) = p⋆(z). (11.41) A Markov chain that respects detailed balance is said to be reversible. Our goal is to use Markov chains to sample from a given distribution. We can achieve this if we set up a Markov chain such that the desired distribution is invariant. However, we must also require that for m →∞, the distribution p(z(m)) converges to the required invariant distribution p⋆(z), irrespective of the choice of initial dis- tribution p(z(0)). This property is called ergodicity, and the invariant distribution is then called the equilibrium distribution. Clearly, an ergodic Markov chain can have only one equilibrium distribution. It can be shown that a homogeneous Markov chain will be ergodic, subject only to weak restrictions on the invariant distribution and the transition probabilities (Neal, 1993). In practice we often construct the transition probabilities from a set of ‘base’ transitions B1, . . . , BK. This can be achieved through a mixture distribution of the form T(z′, z) = K \\x02 k=1 αkBk(z′, z) (11.42)'},\n",

Because the model is represented by a tree-structured directed graph, inference problems can be solved efﬁciently using the sum-product algorithm. The forward re- cursions, analogous to the α messages of the hidden Markov model, are known as the Kalman ﬁlter equations (Kalman, 1960; Zarchan and Musoff, 2005), and the back- ward recursions, analogous to the β messages, are known as the Kalman smoother equations, or the Rauch-Tung-Striebel (RTS) equations (Rauch et al., 1965). The Kalman ﬁlter is widely used in many real-time tracking applications. Because the linear dynamical system is a linear-Gaussian model, the joint distri- bution over all variables, as well as all marginals and conditionals, will be Gaussian. It follows that the sequence of individually most probable latent variable values is the same as the most probable latent sequence. There is thus no need to consider the Exercise 13.19 analogue of the Viterbi algorithm for the linear dynamical system. Because the model has linear-Gaussian conditional distributions, we can write the transition and emission distributions in the general form p(zn|zn−1) = N(zn|Azn−1, Γ) (13.75) p(xn|zn) = N(xn|Czn, Σ). (13.76) The initial latent variable also has a Gaussian distribution which we write as p(z1) = N(z1|µ0, V0). (13.77) Note that in order to simplify the notation, we have omitted additive constant terms from the means of the Gaussians. In fact, it is straightforward to include them if desired. Traditionally, these distributions are more commonly expressed in an equiv- Exercise 13.24 alent form in terms of noisy linear equations given by zn = Azn−1 + wn (13.78) xn = Czn + vn (13.79) z1 = µ0 + u (13.80) where the noise terms have the distributions w ∼ N(w|0, Γ) (13.81) v ∼ N(v|0, Σ) (13.82) u ∼ N(u|0, V0). (13.83) The parameters of the model, denoted by θ = {A, Γ, C, Σ, µ0, V0}, can be determined using maximum likelihood through the EM algorithm. In the E step, we need to solve the inference problem of determining the local posterior marginals for the latent variables, which can be solved efﬁciently using the sum-product algorithm, as we discuss in the next section.',\n",

(3.79) We recognize (3.79) as being equal, up to a constant of proportionality, to the reg- ularized sum-of-squares error function (3.27). We now complete the square over w Exercise 3.18 giving E(w) = E(mN) + 1 2(w −mN)TA(w −mN) (3.80) where we have introduced A = αI + βΦTΦ (3.81) together with E(mN) = β 2 ∥t −ΦmN∥2 + α 2 mT NmN.

Returning to the polynomial regression problem, we can plot the model evidence against the order of the polynomial, as shown in Figure 3.14. Here we have assumed a prior of the form (1.65) with the parameter α ﬁxed at α = 5 × 10−3. The form of this plot is very instructive.

Basic Sampling Algorithms 529 Figure 11.4 In the rejection sampling method, samples are drawn from a sim- ple distribution q(z) and rejected if they fall in the grey area be- tween the unnormalized distribu- tion ep(z) and the scaled distribu- tion kq(z). The resulting samples are distributed according to p(z), which is the normalized version of ep(z). z0 z u0 kq(z0) kq(z) ˜p(z) We next introduce a constant k whose value is chosen such that kq(z) ⩾\\x04p(z) for all values of z. The function kq(z) is called the comparison function and is illus- trated for a univariate distribution in Figure 11.4. Each step of the rejection sampler involves generating two random numbers. First, we generate a number z0 from the distribution q(z). Next, we generate a number u0 from the uniform distribution over [0, kq(z0)]. This pair of random numbers has uniform distribution under the curve of the function kq(z). Finally, if u0 > \\x04p(z0) then the sample is rejected, otherwise u0 is retained. Thus the pair is rejected if it lies in the grey shaded region in Fig- ure 11.4. The remaining pairs then have uniform distribution under the curve of \\x04p(z), and hence the corresponding z values are distributed according to p(z), as desired. Exercise 11.6 The original values of z are generated from the distribution q(z), and these sam- ples are then accepted with probability \\x04p(z)/kq(z), and so the probability that a sample will be accepted is given by p(accept) = \\x06 {\\x04p(z)/kq(z)} q(z) dz = 1 k \\x06 \\x04p(z) dz. (11.14) Thus the fraction of points that are rejected by this method depends on the ratio of the area under the unnormalized distribution \\x04p(z) to the area under the curve kq(z). We therefore see that the constant k should be as small as possible subject to the limitation that kq(z) must be nowhere less than \\x04p(z). As an illustration of the use of rejection sampling, consider the task of sampling from the gamma distribution Gam(z|a, b) = baza−1 exp(−bz) Γ(a) (11.15) which, for a > 1, has a bell-shaped form, as shown in Figure 11.5. A suitable proposal distribution is therefore the Cauchy (11.8) because this too is bell-shaped and because we can use the transformation method, discussed earlier, to sample from it. We need to generalize the Cauchy slightly to ensure that it nowhere has a smaller value than the gamma distribution. This can be achieved by transforming a uniform random variable y using z = b tan y + c, which gives random numbers distributed according to. Exercise 11.7',\n",

       "  'sentence_chunk': 'Preface Pattern recognition has its origins in engineering, whereas machine learning grew out of computer science. However, these activities can be viewed as two facets of the same ﬁeld, and together they have undergone substantial development over the past ten years. In particular, Bayesian methods have grown from a specialist niche to become mainstream, while graphical models have emerged as a general framework for describing and applying probabilistic models. Also, the practical applicability of Bayesian methods has been greatly enhanced through the development of a range of approximate inference algorithms such as variational Bayes and expectation propa- gation. Similarly, new models based on kernels have had signiﬁcant impact on both algorithms and applications. This new textbook reﬂects these recent developments while providing a compre- hensive introduction to the ﬁelds of pattern recognition and machine learning. It is aimed at advanced undergraduates or ﬁrst year PhD students, as well as researchers and practitioners, and assumes no previous knowledge of pattern recognition or ma- chine learning concepts. Knowledge of multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra is required, and some familiarity with probabilities would be helpful though not es- sential as the book includes a self-contained introduction to basic probability theory. Because this book has broad scope, it is impossible to provide a complete list of references, and in particular no attempt has been made to provide accurate historical attribution of ideas. Instead, the aim has been to give references that offer greater detail than is possible here and that hopefully provide entry points into what, in some cases, is a very extensive literature. For this reason, the references are often to more recent textbooks and review articles rather than to original sources.',\n",

       "  'sentence_chunk': 'viii PREFACE Exercises The exercises that appear at the end of every chapter form an important com- ponent of the book. Each exercise has been carefully chosen to reinforce concepts explained in the text or to develop and generalize them in signiﬁcant ways, and each is graded according to difﬁculty ranging from (⋆), which denotes a simple exercise taking a few minutes to complete, through to (⋆⋆⋆), which denotes a signiﬁcantly more complex exercise. It has been difﬁcult to know to what extent these solutions should be made widely available. Those engaged in self study will ﬁnd worked solutions very ben- eﬁcial, whereas many course tutors request that solutions be available only via the publisher so that the exercises may be used in class. In order to try to meet these conﬂicting requirements, those exercises that help amplify key points in the text, or that ﬁll in important details, have solutions that are available as a PDF ﬁle from the book web site. Such exercises are denoted by www . Solutions for the remaining exercises are available to course tutors by contacting the publisher (contact details are given on the book web site). Readers are strongly encouraged to work through the exercises unaided, and to turn to the solutions only as required. Although this book focuses on concepts and principles, in a taught course the students should ideally have the opportunity to experiment with some of the key algorithms using appropriate data sets. A companion volume (Bishop and Nabney, 2008) will deal with practical aspects of pattern recognition and machine learning, and will be accompanied by Matlab software implementing most of the algorithms discussed in this book.

       "  'sentence_chunk': 'Mathematical notation I have tried to keep the mathematical content of the book to the minimum neces- sary to achieve a proper understanding of the ﬁeld. However, this minimum level is nonzero, and it should be emphasized that a good grasp of calculus, linear algebra, and probability theory is essential for a clear understanding of modern pattern recog- nition and machine learning techniques. Nevertheless, the emphasis in this book is on conveying the underlying concepts rather than on mathematical rigour. I have tried to use a consistent notation throughout the book, although at times this means departing from some of the conventions used in the corresponding re- search literature. Vectors are denoted by lower case bold Roman letters such as x, and all vectors are assumed to be column vectors. A superscript T denotes the transpose of a matrix or vector, so that xT will be a row vector. Uppercase bold roman letters, such as M, denote matrices. The notation (w1, . . . ,wM) denotes a row vector with M elements, while the corresponding column vector is written as w = (w1, . . . ,wM)T. The notation [a, b] is used to denote the closed interval from a to b, that is the interval including the values a and b themselves, while (a, b) denotes the correspond- ing open interval, that is the interval excluding a and b. Similarly, [a, b) denotes an interval that includes a but excludes b. For the most part, however, there will be little need to dwell on such reﬁnements as whether the end points of an interval are included or not. The M × M identity matrix (also known as the unit matrix) is denoted IM, which will be abbreviated to I where there is no ambiguity about it dimensionality.',\n",

       "  'sentence_chunk': 'The M × M identity matrix (also known as the unit matrix) is denoted IM, which will be abbreviated to I where there is no ambiguity about it dimensionality. It has elements Iij that equal 1 if i = j and 0 if i ̸= j. A functional is denoted f[y] where y(x) is some function. The concept of a functional is discussed in Appendix D. The notation g(x) = O(f(x)) denotes that |f(x)/g(x)| is bounded as x →∞. For instance if g(x) = 3x2 + 2, then g(x) = O(x2). The expectation of a function f(x, y) with respect to a random variable x is de- noted by Ex[f(x, y)]. In situations where there is no ambiguity as to which variable is being averaged over, this will be simpliﬁed by omitting the sufﬁx, for instance xi',\n",

If the distribution of x is conditioned on another variable z, then the corre- sponding conditional expectation will be written Ex[f(x)|z]. Similarly, the variance is denoted var[f(x)], and for vector variables the covariance is written cov[x, y]. We shall also use cov[x] as a shorthand notation for cov[x, x]. The concepts of expecta- tions and covariances are introduced in Section 1.2.2. If we have N values x1, . . . ,xN of a D-dimensional vector x = (x1, . . . ,xD)T, we can combine the observations into a data matrix X in which the nth row of X corresponds to the row vector xT n. Thus the n, i element of X corresponds to the ith element of the nth observation xn. For the case of one-dimensional variables we shall denote such a matrix by x, which is a column vector whose nth element is xn. Note that x (which has dimensionality N) uses a different typeface to distinguish it from x (which has dimensionality D).',\n",

       "  'sentence_chunk': '1 Introduction The problem of searching for patterns in data is a fundamental one and has a long and successful history. For instance, the extensive astronomical observations of Tycho Brahe in the 16th century allowed Johannes Kepler to discover the empirical laws of planetary motion, which in turn provided a springboard for the development of clas- sical mechanics. Similarly, the discovery of regularities in atomic spectra played a key role in the development and veriﬁcation of quantum physics in the early twenti- eth century. The ﬁeld of pattern recognition is concerned with the automatic discov- ery of regularities in data through the use of computer algorithms and with the use of these regularities to take actions such as classifying the data into different categories. Consider the example of recognizing handwritten digits, illustrated in Figure 1.1. Each digit corresponds to a 28×28 pixel image and so can be represented by a vector x comprising 784 real numbers. The goal is to build a machine that will take such a vector x as input and that will produce the identity of the digit 0, . . . ,9 as the output. This is a nontrivial problem due to the wide variability of handwriting. It could be 1',\n",

Far better results can be obtained by adopting a machine learning approach in which a large set of N digits {x1, . . . ,xN} called a training set is used to tune the parameters of an adaptive model. The categories of the digits in the training set are known in advance, typically by inspecting them individually and hand-labelling them. We can express the category of a digit using target vector t, which represents the identity of the corresponding digit. Suitable techniques for representing cate- gories in terms of vectors will be discussed later. Note that there is one such target vector t for each digit image x. The result of running the machine learning algorithm can be expressed as a function y(x) which takes a new digit image x as input and that generates an output vector y, encoded in the same way as the target vectors. The precise form of the function y(x) is determined during the training phase, also known as the learning phase, on the basis of the training data. Once the model is trained it can then de- termine the identity of new digit images, which are said to comprise a test set.',\n",

The ability to categorize correctly new examples that differ from those used for train- ing is known as generalization. In practical applications, the variability of the input vectors will be such that the training data can comprise only a tiny fraction of all possible input vectors, and so generalization is a central goal in pattern recognition. For most practical applications, the original input variables are typically prepro- cessed to transform them into some new space of variables where, it is hoped, the pattern recognition problem will be easier to solve. For instance, in the digit recogni- tion problem, the images of the digits are typically translated and scaled so that each digit is contained within a box of a ﬁxed size. This greatly reduces the variability within each digit class, because the location and scale of all the digits are now the same, which makes it much easier for a subsequent pattern recognition algorithm to distinguish between the different classes. This pre-processing stage is sometimes also called feature extraction. Note that new test data must be pre-processed using the same steps as the training data. Pre-processing might also be performed in order to speed up computation. For example, if the goal is real-time face detection in a high-resolution video stream, the computer must handle huge numbers of pixels per second, and presenting these directly to a complex pattern recognition algorithm may be computationally infeasi- ble. Instead, the aim is to ﬁnd useful features that are fast to compute, and yet that',\n",

These features are then used as the inputs to the pattern recognition algorithm. For instance, the average value of the image intensity over a rectangular subregion can be evaluated extremely efﬁciently (Viola and Jones, 2004), and a set of such features can prove very effective in fast face detection. Because the number of such features is smaller than the number of pixels, this kind of pre-processing repre- sents a form of dimensionality reduction. Care must be taken during pre-processing because often information is discarded, and if this information is important to the solution of the problem then the overall accuracy of the system can suffer. Applications in which the training data comprises examples of the input vectors along with their corresponding target vectors are known as supervised learning prob- lems. Cases such as the digit recognition example, in which the aim is to assign each input vector to one of a ﬁnite number of discrete categories, are called classiﬁcation problems. If the desired output consists of one or more continuous variables, then the task is called regression. An example of a regression problem would be the pre- diction of the yield in a chemical manufacturing process in which the inputs consist of the concentrations of reactants, the temperature, and the pressure. In other pattern recognition problems, the training data consists of a set of input vectors x without any corresponding target values.',\n",

The goal in such unsupervised learning problems may be to discover groups of similar examples within the data, where it is called clustering, or to determine the distribution of data within the input space, known as density estimation, or to project the data from a high-dimensional space down to two or three dimensions for the purpose of visualization. Finally, the technique of reinforcement learning (Sutton and Barto, 1998) is con- cerned with the problem of ﬁnding suitable actions to take in a given situation in order to maximize a reward. Here the learning algorithm is not given examples of optimal outputs, in contrast to supervised learning, but must instead discover them by a process of trial and error. Typically there is a sequence of states and actions in which the learning algorithm is interacting with its environment. In many cases, the current action not only affects the immediate reward but also has an impact on the re- ward at all subsequent time steps. For example, by using appropriate reinforcement learning techniques a neural network can learn to play the game of backgammon to a high standard (Tesauro, 1994). Here the network must learn to take a board position as input, along with the result of a dice throw, and produce a strong move as the output. This is done by having the network play against a copy of itself for perhaps a million games. A major challenge is that a game of backgammon can involve dozens of moves, and yet it is only at the end of the game that the reward, in the form of victory, is achieved. The reward must then be attributed appropriately to all of the moves that led to it, even though some moves will have been good ones and others less so.',\n",

Although each of these tasks needs its own tools and techniques, many of the key ideas that underpin them are common to all such problems. One of the main goals of this chapter is to introduce, in a relatively informal way, several of the most important of these concepts and to illustrate them using simple examples. Later in the book we shall see these same ideas re-emerge in the context of more sophisti- cated models that are applicable to real-world pattern recognition applications. This chapter also provides a self-contained introduction to three important tools that will be used throughout the book, namely probability theory, decision theory, and infor- mation theory. Although these might sound like daunting topics, they are in fact straightforward, and a clear understanding of them is essential if machine learning techniques are to be used to best effect in practical applications.1.1.

For the present purposes, it is in- structive to consider an artiﬁcial example using synthetically generated data because we then know the precise process that generated the data for comparison against any learned model. The data for this example is generated from the function sin(2πx) with random noise included in the target values, as described in detail in Appendix A. Now suppose that we are given a training set comprising N observations of x, written x ≡(x1, . . . ,xN)T, together with corresponding observations of the values of t, denoted t ≡(t1, . . . ,tN)T. Figure 1.2 shows a plot of a training set comprising N = 10 data points.

By generating data in this way, we are capturing a property of many real data sets, namely that they possess an underlying regularity, which we wish to learn, but that individual observations are corrupted by random noise. This noise might arise from intrinsically stochastic (i.e. random) pro- cesses such as radioactive decay but more typically is due to there being sources of variability that are themselves unobserved. Our goal is to exploit this training set in order to make predictions of the value \\x01t of the target variable for some new value \\x01x of the input variable. As we shall see later, this involves implicitly trying to discover the underlying function sin(2πx). This is intrinsically a difﬁcult problem as we have to generalize from a ﬁnite data set. Furthermore the observed data are corrupted with noise, and so for a given \\x01x there is uncertainty as to the appropriate value for \\x01t. Probability theory, discussed in Section 1.2, provides a framework for expressing such uncertainty in a precise and quantitative manner, and decision theory, discussed in Section 1.5, allows us to exploit this probabilistic representation in order to make predictions that are optimal according to appropriate criteria. For the moment, however, we shall proceed rather informally and consider a simple approach based on curve ﬁtting. In particular, we shall ﬁt the data using a polynomial function of the form y(x, w) = w0 + w1x + w2x2 + . . .',\n",

The polynomial coefﬁcients w0, . . . ,wM are collectively denoted by the vector w. Note that, although the polynomial function y(x, w) is a nonlinear function of x, it is a linear function of the coefﬁcients w. Functions, such as the polynomial, which are linear in the unknown parameters have important properties and are called linear models and will be discussed extensively in Chapters 3 and 4. The values of the coefﬁcients will be determined by ﬁtting the polynomial to the training data. This can be done by minimizing an error function that measures the misﬁt between the function y(x, w), for any given value of w, and the training set data points. One simple choice of error function, which is widely used, is given by the sum of the squares of the errors between the predictions y(xn, w) for each data point xn and the corresponding target values tn, so that we minimize E(w) = 1 2 N \\x02 n=1 {y(xn, w) −tn}2 (1.2) where the factor of 1/2 is included for later convenience.

INTRODUCTION Figure 1.3 The error function (1.2) corre- sponds to (one half of) the sum of the squares of the displacements (shown by the vertical green bars) of each data point from the function y(x, w).t x y(xn, w) tn xn function y(x, w) were to pass exactly through each training data point. The geomet- rical interpretation of the sum-of-squares error function is illustrated in Figure 1.3. We can solve the curve ﬁtting problem by choosing the value of w for which E(w) is as small as possible. Because the error function is a quadratic function of the coefﬁcients w, its derivatives with respect to the coefﬁcients will be linear in the elements of w, and so the minimization of the error function has a unique solution, denoted by w⋆, which can be found in closed form. The resulting polynomial is Exercise 1.1 given by the function y(x, w⋆). There remains the problem of choosing the order M of the polynomial, and as we shall see this will turn out to be an example of an important concept called model comparison or model selection. In Figure 1.4, we show four examples of the results of ﬁtting polynomials having orders M = 0, 1, 3, and 9 to the data set shown in Figure 1.2. We notice that the constant (M = 0) and ﬁrst order (M = 1) polynomials give rather poor ﬁts to the data and consequently rather poor representations of the function sin(2πx). The third order (M = 3) polynomial seems to give the best ﬁt to the function sin(2πx) of the examples shown in Figure 1.4.',\n",

However, the ﬁtted curve oscillates wildly and gives a very poor representation of the function sin(2πx). This latter behaviour is known as over-ﬁtting. As we have noted earlier, the goal is to achieve good generalization by making accurate predictions for new data. We can obtain some quantitative insight into the dependence of the generalization performance on M by considering a separate test set comprising 100 data points generated using exactly the same procedure used to generate the training set points but with new choices for the random noise values included in the target values. For each choice of M, we can then evaluate the residual value of E(w⋆) given by (1.2) for the training data, and we can also evaluate E(w⋆) for the test data set.

However, the test set error has become very large and, as we saw in Figure 1.4, the corresponding function y(x, w⋆) exhibits wild oscillations. This may seem paradoxical because a polynomial of given order contains all lower order polynomials as special cases. The M = 9 polynomial is therefore capa- ble of generating results at least as good as the M = 3 polynomial. Furthermore, we might suppose that the best predictor of new data would be the function sin(2πx) from which the data was generated (and we shall see later that this is indeed the case). We know that a power series expansion of the function sin(2πx) contains terms of all orders, so we might expect that results should improve monotonically as we increase M. We can gain some insight into the problem by examining the values of the co- efﬁcients w⋆obtained from polynomials of various order, as shown in Table 1.1.

Intuitively, what is happening is that the more ﬂexible polynomials with larger values of M are becoming increasingly tuned to the random noise on the target values. It is also interesting to examine the behaviour of a given model as the size of the data set is varied, as shown in Figure 1.6. We see that, for a given model complexity, the over-ﬁtting problem become less severe as the size of the data set increases. Another way to say this is that the larger the data set, the more complex (in other words more ﬂexible) the model that we can afford to ﬁt to the data. One rough heuristic that is sometimes advocated is that the number of data points should be no less than some multiple (say 5 or 10) of the number of adaptive parameters in the model.

One technique that is often used to control the over-ﬁtting phenomenon in such cases is that of regularization, which involves adding a penalty term to the error function (1.2) in order to discourage the coefﬁcients from reaching large values. The simplest such penalty term takes the form of a sum of squares of all of the coefﬁcients, leading to a modiﬁed error function of the form \\x04E(w) = 1 2 N \\x02 n=1 {y(xn, w) −tn}2 + λ 2 ∥w∥2 (1.4) where ∥w∥2 ≡wTw = w2 0 + w2 1 + . . .+ w2 M, and the coefﬁcient λ governs the rel- ative importance of the regularization term compared with the sum-of-squares error term. Note that often the coefﬁcient w0 is omitted from the regularizer because its inclusion causes the results to depend on the choice of origin for the target variable (Hastie et al.,2001), or it may be included but with its own regularization coefﬁcient (we shall discuss this topic in more detail in Section 5.5.1).

INTRODUCTION give us some important insights into the concepts we have introduced in the con- text of polynomial curve ﬁtting and will allow us to extend these to more complex situations.1.2. Probability Theory A key concept in the ﬁeld of pattern recognition is that of uncertainty. It arises both through noise on measurements, as well as through the ﬁnite size of data sets. Prob- ability theory provides a consistent framework for the quantiﬁcation and manipula- tion of uncertainty and forms one of the central foundations for pattern recognition. When combined with decision theory, discussed in Section 1.5, it allows us to make optimal predictions given all the information available to us, even though that infor- mation may be incomplete or ambiguous. We will introduce the basic concepts of probability theory by considering a sim- ple example. Imagine we have two boxes, one red and one blue, and in the red box we have 2 apples and 6 oranges, and in the blue box we have 3 apples and 1 orange. This is illustrated in Figure 1.9. Now suppose we randomly pick one of the boxes and from that box we randomly select an item of fruit, and having observed which sort of fruit it is we replace it in the box from which it came.',\n",

Let us suppose that in so doing we pick the red box 40% of the time and we pick the blue box 60% of the time, and that when we remove an item of fruit from a box we are equally likely to select any of the pieces of fruit in the box. In this example, the identity of the box that will be chosen is a random variable, which we shall denote by B. This random variable can take one of two possible values, namely r (corresponding to the red box) or b (corresponding to the blue box). Similarly, the identity of the fruit is also a random variable and will be denoted by F. It can take either of the values a (for apple) or o (for orange). To begin with, we shall deﬁne the probability of an event to be the fraction of times that event occurs out of the total number of trials, in the limit that the total number of trials goes to inﬁnity.

Note that p(X = xi) is sometimes called the marginal probability, because it is obtained by marginalizing, or summing out, the other variables (in this case Y ). If we consider only those instances for which X = xi, then the fraction of such instances for which Y = yj is written p(Y = yj|X = xi) and is called the conditional probability of Y = yj given X = xi. It is obtained by ﬁnding the fraction of those points in column i that fall in cell i,j and hence is given by p(Y = yj|X = xi) = nij ci . (1.8) From (1.5), (1.6), and (1.8), we can then derive the following relationship p(X = xi, Y = yj) = nij N = nij ci · ci N = p(Y = yj|X = xi)p(X = xi) (1.9) which is the product rule of probability. So far we have been quite careful to make a distinction between a random vari- able, such as the box B in the fruit example, and the values that the random variable can take, for example r if the box were the red one. Thus the probability that B takes the value r is denoted p(B = r). Although this helps to avoid ambiguity, it leads to a rather cumbersome notation, and in many cases there will be no need for such pedantry. Instead, we may simply write p(B) to denote a distribution over the ran- dom variable B, or p(r) to denote the distribution evaluated for the particular value r, provided that the interpretation is clear from the context. With this more compact notation, we can write the two fundamental rules of probability theory in the following form.',\n",

These two simple rules form the basis for all of the probabilistic machinery that we use throughout this book. From the product rule, together with the symmetry property p(X, Y ) = p(Y, X), we immediately obtain the following relationship between conditional probabilities p(Y |X) = p(X|Y )p(Y ) p(X) (1.12) which is called Bayes’ theorem and which plays a central role in pattern recognition and machine learning. Using the sum rule, the denominator in Bayes’ theorem can be expressed in terms of the quantities appearing in the numerator p(X) = \\x02 Y p(X|Y )p(Y ). (1.13) We can view the denominator in Bayes’ theorem as being the normalization constant required to ensure that the sum of the conditional probability on the left-hand side of (1.12) over all values of Y equals one. In Figure 1.11, we show a simple example involving a joint distribution over two variables to illustrate the concept of marginal and conditional distributions. Here a ﬁnite sample of N = 60 data points has been drawn from the joint distribution and is shown in the top left. In the top right is a histogram of the fractions of data points having each of the two values of Y . From the deﬁnition of probability, these fractions would equal the corresponding probabilities p(Y ) in the limit N →∞.

Note that these satisfy p(B = r) + p(B = b) = 1. Now suppose that we pick a box at random, and it turns out to be the blue box. Then the probability of selecting an apple is just the fraction of apples in the blue box which is 3/4, and so p(F = a|B = b) = 3/4. In fact, we can write out all four conditional probabilities for the type of fruit, given the selected box p(F = a|B = r) = 1/4 (1.16) p(F = o|B = r) = 3/4 (1.17) p(F = a|B = b) = 3/4 (1.18) p(F = o|B = b) = 1/4.

This requires that we evaluate the probability distribution over boxes conditioned on the identity of the fruit, whereas the probabilities in (1.16)–(1.19) give the probability distribution over the fruit conditioned on the identity of the box. We can solve the problem of reversing the conditional probability by using Bayes’ theorem to give p(B = r|F = o) = p(F = o|B = r)p(B = r) p(F = o) = 3 4 × 4 10 × 20 9 = 2 3. (1.23) From the sum rule, it then follows that p(B = b|F = o) = 1 −2/3 = 1/3. We can provide an important interpretation of Bayes’ theorem as follows. If we had been asked which box had been chosen before being told the identity of the selected item of fruit, then the most complete information we have available is provided by the probability p(B). We call this the prior probability because it is the probability available before we observe the identity of the fruit. Once we are told that the fruit is an orange, we can then use Bayes’ theorem to compute the probability p(B|F), which we shall call the posterior probability because it is the probability obtained after we have observed F. Note that in this example, the prior probability of selecting the red box was 4/10, so that we were more likely to select the blue box than the red one. However, once we have observed that the piece of selected fruit is an orange, we ﬁnd that the posterior probability of the red box is now 2/3, so that it is now more likely that the box we selected was in fact the red one. This result accords with our intuition, as the proportion of oranges is much higher in the red box than it is in the blue box, and so the observation that the fruit was an orange provides signiﬁcant evidence favouring the red box.',\n",

In fact, the evidence is sufﬁciently strong that it outweighs the prior and makes it more likely that the red box was chosen rather than the blue one. Finally, we note that if the joint distribution of two variables factorizes into the product of the marginals, so that p(X, Y ) = p(X)p(Y ), then X and Y are said to be independent. From the product rule, we see that p(Y |X) = p(Y ), and so the conditional distribution of Y given X is indeed independent of the value of X. For instance, in our boxes of fruit example, if each box contained the same fraction of apples and oranges, then p(F|B) = P(F), so that the probability of selecting, say, an apple is independent of which box is chosen.1.2.1 Probability densities As well as considering probabilities deﬁned over discrete sets of events, we also wish to consider probabilities with respect to continuous variables. We shall limit ourselves to a relatively informal discussion. If the probability of a real-valued variable x falling in the interval (x, x + δx) is given by p(x)δx for δx →0, then p(x) is called the probability density over x. This is illustrated in Figure 1.12. The probability that x will lie in an interval (a, b) is then given by p(x ∈(a, b)) = \\x06 b a p(x) dx. (1.24)',\n",

INTRODUCTION Figure 1.12 The concept of probability for discrete variables can be ex- tended to that of a probability density p(x) over a continuous variable x and is such that the probability of x lying in the inter- val (x, x+δx) is given by p(x)δx for δx →0. The probability density can be expressed as the derivative of a cumulative distri- bution function P(x).x δx p(x) P(x) Because probabilities are nonnegative, and because the value of x must lie some- where on the real axis, the probability density p(x) must satisfy the two conditions p(x) ⩾ 0 (1.25) \\x06 ∞ −∞ p(x) dx = 1. (1.26) Under a nonlinear change of variable, a probability density transforms differently from a simple function, due to the Jacobian factor. For instance, if we consider a change of variables x = g(y), then a function f(x) becomes \\x04f(y) = f(g(y)). Now consider a probability density px(x) that corresponds to a density py(y) with respect to the new variable y, where the sufﬁces denote the fact that px(x) and py(y) are different densities. Observations falling in the range (x, x + δx) will, for small values of δx, be transformed into the range (y, y + δy) where px(x)δx ≃py(y)δy, and hence py(y) = px(x) \\x07\\x07\\x07\\x07 dx dy \\x07\\x07\\x07\\x07 = px(g(y)) |g′(y)| . (1.27) One consequence of this property is that the concept of the maximum of a probability density is dependent on the choice of variable. Exercise 1.4 The probability that x lies in the interval (−∞, z) is given by the cumulative distribution function deﬁned by P(z) = \\x06 z −∞ p(x) dx (1.28) which satisﬁes P ′(x) = p(x), as shown in Figure 1.12.

This multivariate probability density must satisfy p(x) ⩾ 0 (1.29) \\x06 p(x) dx = 1 (1.30) in which the integral is taken over the whole of x space. We can also consider joint probability distributions over a combination of discrete and continuous variables. Note that if x is a discrete variable, then p(x) is sometimes called a probability mass function because it can be regarded as a set of ‘probability masses’ concentrated at the allowed values of x. The sum and product rules of probability, as well as Bayes’ theorem, apply equally to the case of probability densities, or to combinations of discrete and con- tinuous variables. For instance, if x and y are two real variables, then the sum and product rules take the form p(x) = \\x06 p(x, y) dy (1.31) p(x, y) = p(y|x)p(x). (1.32) A formal justiﬁcation of the sum and product rules for continuous variables (Feller, 1966) requires a branch of mathematics called measure theory and lies outside the scope of this book. Its validity can be seen informally, however, by dividing each real variable into intervals of width ∆and considering the discrete probability dis- tribution over these intervals. Taking the limit ∆→0 then turns sums into integrals and gives the desired result.1.2.2 Expectations and covariances One of the most important operations involving probabilities is that of ﬁnding weighted averages of functions.

Note that Ex[f(x, y)] will be a function of y. We can also consider a conditional expectation with respect to a conditional distribution, so that Ex[f|y] = \\x02 x p(x|y)f(x) (1.37) with an analogous deﬁnition for continuous variables.

We shall refer to this as the classical or frequentist interpretation of probability. Now we turn to the more general Bayesian view, in which probabilities provide a quantiﬁcation of uncertainty. Consider an uncertain event, for example whether the moon was once in its own orbit around the sun, or whether the Arctic ice cap will have disappeared by the end of the century. These are not events that can be repeated numerous times in order to deﬁne a notion of probability as we did earlier in the context of boxes of fruit. Nevertheless, we will generally have some idea, for example, of how quickly we think the polar ice is melting. If we now obtain fresh evidence, for instance from a new Earth observation satellite gathering novel forms of diagnostic information, we may revise our opinion on the rate of ice loss. Our assessment of such matters will affect the actions we take, for instance the extent to which we endeavour to reduce the emission of greenhouse gasses. In such circumstances, we would like to be able to quantify our expression of uncertainty and make precise revisions of uncertainty in the light of new evidence, as well as subsequently to be able to take optimal actions or decisions as a consequence. This can all be achieved through the elegant, and very general, Bayesian interpretation of probability.',\n",

The use of probability to represent uncertainty, however, is not an ad-hoc choice, but is inevitable if we are to respect common sense while making rational coherent inferences. For instance, Cox (1946) showed that if numerical values are used to represent degrees of belief, then a simple set of axioms encoding common sense properties of such beliefs leads uniquely to a set of rules for manipulating degrees of belief that are equivalent to the sum and product rules of probability. This provided the ﬁrst rigorous proof that probability theory could be regarded as an extension of Boolean logic to situations involving uncertainty (Jaynes, 2003). Numerous other authors have proposed different sets of properties or axioms that such measures of uncertainty should satisfy (Ramsey, 1931; Good, 1950; Savage, 1961; deFinetti, 1970; Lindley, 1982). In each case, the resulting numerical quantities behave pre- cisely according to the rules of probability. It is therefore natural to refer to these quantities as (Bayesian) probabilities.

It seems reasonable to apply the frequentist notion of probability to the random values of the observed variables tn. However, we would like to address and quantify the uncertainty that surrounds the appropriate choice for the model param- eters w. We shall see that, from a Bayesian perspective, we can use the machinery of probability theory to describe the uncertainty in model parameters such as w, or indeed in the choice of model itself. Bayes’ theorem now acquires a new signiﬁcance. Recall that in the boxes of fruit example, the observation of the identity of the fruit provided relevant information that altered the probability that the chosen box was the red one. In that example, Bayes’ theorem was used to convert a prior probability into a posterior probability by incorporating the evidence provided by the observed data. As we shall see in detail later, we can adopt a similar approach when making inferences about quantities such as the parameters w in the polynomial curve ﬁtting example. We capture our assumptions about w, before observing the data, in the form of a prior probability distribution p(w). The effect of the observed data D = {t1, . . . ,',\n",

Bayes’ theorem, which takes the form p(w|D) = p(D|w)p(w) p(D) (1.43) then allows us to evaluate the uncertainty in w after we have observed D in the form of the posterior probability p(w|D). The quantity p(D|w) on the right-hand side of Bayes’ theorem is evaluated for the observed data set D and can be viewed as a function of the parameter vector w, in which case it is called the likelihood function. It expresses how probable the observed data set is for different settings of the parameter vector w. Note that the likelihood is not a probability distribution over w, and its integral with respect to w does not (necessarily) equal one. Given this deﬁnition of likelihood, we can state Bayes’ theorem in words posterior ∝likelihood × prior (1.44) where all of these quantities are viewed as functions of w. The denominator in (1.43) is the normalization constant, which ensures that the posterior distribution on the left-hand side is a valid probability density and integrates to one. Indeed, integrating both sides of (1.43) with respect to w, we can express the denominator in Bayes’ theorem in terms of the prior distribution and the likelihood function p(D) = \\x06 p(D|w)p(w) dw. (1.45) In both the Bayesian and frequentist paradigms, the likelihood function p(D|w) plays a central role. However, the manner in which it is used is fundamentally dif- ferent in the two approaches. In a frequentist setting, w is considered to be a ﬁxed parameter, whose value is determined by some form of ‘estimator’, and error bars',\n",

By contrast, from the Bayesian viewpoint there is only a single data set D (namely the one that is actually observed), and the uncertainty in the parameters is expressed through a probability distribution over w. A widely used frequentist estimator is maximum likelihood, in which w is set to the value that maximizes the likelihood function p(D|w). This corresponds to choosing the value of w for which the probability of the observed data set is maxi- mized. In the machine learning literature, the negative log of the likelihood function is called an error function. Because the negative logarithm is a monotonically de- creasing function, maximizing the likelihood is equivalent to minimizing the error. One approach to determining frequentist error bars is the bootstrap (Efron, 1979; Hastie et al.,2001), in which multiple data sets are created as follows. Suppose our original data set consists of N data points X = {x1, . . . ,xN}. We can create a new data set XB by drawing N points at random from X, with replacement, so that some points in X may be replicated in XB, whereas other points in X may be absent from XB. This process can be repeated L times to generate L data sets each of size N and each obtained by sampling from the original data set X. The statistical accuracy of parameter estimates can then be evaluated by looking at the variability of predictions between the different bootstrap data sets.',\n",

One advantage of the Bayesian viewpoint is that the inclusion of prior knowl- edge arises naturally. Suppose, for instance, that a fair-looking coin is tossed three times and lands heads each time. A classical maximum likelihood estimate of the probability of landing heads would give 1, implying that all future tosses will land Section 2.1 heads!By contrast, a Bayesian approach with any reasonable prior will lead to a much less extreme conclusion. There has been much controversy and debate associated with the relative mer- its of the frequentist and Bayesian paradigms, which have not been helped by the fact that there is no unique frequentist, or even Bayesian, viewpoint. For instance, one common criticism of the Bayesian approach is that the prior distribution is of- ten selected on the basis of mathematical convenience rather than as a reﬂection of any prior beliefs. Even the subjective nature of the conclusions through their de- pendence on the choice of prior is seen by some as a source of difﬁculty. Reducing the dependence on the prior is one motivation for so-called noninformative priors. Section 2.4.3 However, these lead to difﬁculties when comparing different models, and indeed Bayesian methods based on poor choices of prior can give poor results with high conﬁdence.

The development of sampling methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (discussed in Chapter 11) along with dramatic improvements in the speed and memory capacity of computers, opened the door to the practical use of Bayesian techniques in an im- pressive range of problem domains. Monte Carlo methods are very ﬂexible and can be applied to a wide range of models. However, they are computationally intensive and have mainly been used for small-scale problems. More recently, highly efﬁcient deterministic approximation schemes such as variational Bayes and expectation propagation (discussed in Chapter 10) have been developed. These offer a complementary alternative to sampling methods and have allowed Bayesian techniques to be used in large-scale applications (Blei et al.,2003).1.2.4 The Gaussian distribution We shall devote the whole of Chapter 2 to a study of various probability dis- tributions and their key properties.

We shall suppose that the observations are drawn independently from a Gaussian distribution whose mean µ and variance σ2 are unknown, and we would like to determine these parameters from the data set. Data points that are drawn independently from the same distribution are said to be independent and identically distributed, which is often abbreviated to i.i.d. We have seen that the joint probability of two independent events is given by the product of the marginal probabilities for each event separately.

One common criterion for determining the parameters in a probability distribu- tion using an observed data set is to ﬁnd the parameter values that maximize the likelihood function. This might seem like a strange criterion because, from our fore- going discussion of probability theory, it would seem more natural to maximize the probability of the parameters given the data, not the probability of the data given the parameters. In fact, these two criteria are related, as we shall discuss in the context of curve ﬁtting.

In prac- tice, it is more convenient to maximize the log of the likelihood function. Because the logarithm is a monotonically increasing function of its argument, maximization of the log of a function is equivalent to maximization of the function itself. Taking the log not only simpliﬁes the subsequent mathematical analysis, but it also helps numerically because the product of a large number of small probabilities can easily underﬂow the numerical precision of the computer, and this is resolved by computing instead the sum of the log probabilities.

The green curve shows the true Gaussian distribution from which data is generated, and the three red curves show the Gaussian distributions obtained by ﬁtting to three data sets, each consist- ing of two data points shown in blue, us- ing the maximum likelihood results (1.55) and (1.56). Averaged across the three data sets, the mean is correct, but the variance is systematically under-estimated because it is measured relative to the sample mean and not relative to the true mean. (a) (b) (c) In Section 10.1.3, we shall see how this result arises automatically when we adopt a Bayesian approach. Note that the bias of the maximum likelihood solution becomes less signiﬁcant as the number N of data points increases, and in the limit N →∞the maximum likelihood solution for the variance equals the true variance of the distribution that generated the data. In practice, for anything other than small N, this bias will not prove to be a serious problem. However, throughout this book we shall be interested in more complex models with many parameters, for which the bias problems asso- ciated with maximum likelihood will be much more severe. In fact, as we shall see, the issue of bias in maximum likelihood lies at the root of the over-ﬁtting problem that we encountered earlier in the context of polynomial curve ﬁtting.1.2.5 Curve ﬁtting re-visited We have seen how the problem of polynomial curve ﬁtting can be expressed in terms of error minimization. Here we return to the curve ﬁtting example and view it Section 1.1 from a probabilistic perspective, thereby gaining some insights into error functions and regularization, as well as taking us towards a full Bayesian treatment.',\n",

The goal in the curve ﬁtting problem is to be able to make predictions for the target variable t given some new value of the input variable x on the basis of a set of training data comprising N input values x = (x1, . . . ,xN)T and their corresponding target values t = (t1, . . . ,tN)T. We can express our uncertainty over the value of the target variable using a probability distribution. For this purpose, we shall assume that, given the value of x, the corresponding value of t has a Gaussian distribution with a mean equal to the value y(x, w) of the polynomial curve given by (1.1). Thus we have p(t|x, w, β) = N t|y(x, w), β−1\\x0b (1.60) where, for consistency with the notation in later chapters, we have deﬁned a preci- sion parameter β corresponding to the inverse variance of the distribution.

These are determined by maxi- mizing (1.62) with respect to w. For this purpose, we can omit the last two terms on the right-hand side of (1.62) because they do not depend on w. Also, we note that scaling the log likelihood by a positive constant coefﬁcient does not alter the location of the maximum with respect to w, and so we can replace the coefﬁcient β/2 with 1/2. Finally, instead of maximizing the log likelihood, we can equivalently minimize the negative log likelihood. We therefore see that maximizing likelihood is equivalent, so far as determining w is concerned, to minimizing the sum-of-squares error function deﬁned by (1.2).

INTRODUCTION Again we can ﬁrst determine the parameter vector wML governing the mean and sub- sequently use this to ﬁnd the precision βML as was the case for the simple Gaussian distribution. Section 1.2.4 Having determined the parameters w and β, we can now make predictions for new values of x. Because we now have a probabilistic model, these are expressed in terms of the predictive distribution that gives the probability distribution over t, rather than simply a point estimate, and is obtained by substituting the maximum likelihood parameters into (1.60) to give p(t|x, wML, βML) = N t|y(x, wML), β−1 ML \\x0b . (1.64) Now let us take a step towards a more Bayesian approach and introduce a prior distribution over the polynomial coefﬁcients w. For simplicity, let us consider a Gaussian distribution of the form p(w|α) = N(w|0, α−1I) = \\x11 α 2π \\x12(M+1)/2 exp \\x13 −α 2 wTw \\x14 (1.65) where α is the precision of the distribution, and M +1 is the total number of elements in the vector w for an M th order polynomial. Variables such as α, which control the distribution of model parameters, are called hyperparameters. Using Bayes’ theorem, the posterior distribution for w is proportional to the product of the prior distribution and the likelihood function p(w|x, t, α, β) ∝p(t|x, w, β)p(w|α). (1.66) We can now determine w by ﬁnding the most probable value of w given the data, in other words by maximizing the posterior distribution. This technique is called maximum posterior, or simply MAP. Taking the negative logarithm of (1.66) and combining with (1.62) and (1.65), we ﬁnd that the maximum of the posterior is given by the minimum of β 2 N \\x02 n=1 {y(xn, w) −tn}2 + α 2 wTw. (1.67) Thus we see that maximizing the posterior distribution is equivalent to minimizing the regularized sum-of-squares error function encountered earlier in the form (1.4), with a regularization parameter given by λ = α/β.1.2.6 Bayesian curve ﬁtting Although we have included a prior distribution p(w|α), we are so far still mak- ing a point estimate of w and so this does not yet amount to a Bayesian treatment.',\n",

We therefore wish to evaluate the predictive distribution p(t|x, x, t). Here we shall assume that the parameters α and β are ﬁxed and known in advance (in later chapters we shall discuss how such parameters can be inferred from data in a Bayesian setting). A Bayesian treatment simply corresponds to a consistent application of the sum and product rules of probability, which allow the predictive distribution to be written in the form p(t|x, x, t) = \\x06 p(t|x, w)p(w|x, t) dw. (1.68) Here p(t|x, w) is given by (1.60), and we have omitted the dependence on α and β to simplify the notation. Here p(w|x, t) is the posterior distribution over param- eters, and can be found by normalizing the right-hand side of (1.66). We shall see in Section 3.3 that, for problems such as the curve-ﬁtting example, this posterior distribution is a Gaussian and can be evaluated analytically. Similarly, the integra- tion in (1.68) can also be performed analytically with the result that the predictive distribution is given by a Gaussian of the form p(t|x, x, t) = N t|m(x), s2(x) \\x0b (1.69) where the mean and variance are given by m(x) = βφ(x)TS N \\x02 n=1 φ(xn)tn (1.70) s2(x) = β−1 + φ(x)TSφ(x).

We see that the variance, as well as the mean, of the predictive distribution in (1.69) is dependent on x. The ﬁrst term in (1.71) represents the uncertainty in the predicted value of t due to the noise on the target variables and was expressed already in the maximum likelihood predictive distribution (1.64) through β−1 ML. However, the second term arises from the uncertainty in the parameters w and is a consequence of the Bayesian treatment.',\n",

Model Selection In our example of polynomial curve ﬁtting using least squares, we saw that there was an optimal order of polynomial that gave the best generalization. The order of the polynomial controls the number of free parameters in the model and thereby governs the model complexity. With regularized least squares, the regularization coefﬁcient λ also controls the effective complexity of the model, whereas for more complex models, such as mixture distributions or neural networks there may be multiple pa- rameters governing complexity. In a practical application, we need to determine the values of such parameters, and the principal objective in doing so is usually to achieve the best predictive performance on new data. Furthermore, as well as ﬁnd- ing the appropriate values for complexity parameters within a given model, we may wish to consider a range of different types of model in order to ﬁnd the best one for our particular application. We have already seen that, in the maximum likelihood approach, the perfor- mance on the training set is not a good indicator of predictive performance on un- seen data due to the problem of over-ﬁtting. If data is plentiful, then one approach is simply to use some of the available data to train a range of models, or a given model with a range of values for its complexity parameters, and then to compare them on independent data, sometimes called a validation set, and select the one having the best predictive performance. If the model design is iterated many times using a lim- ited size data set, then some over-ﬁtting to the validation data can occur and so it may be necessary to keep aside a third test set on which the performance of the selected model is ﬁnally evaluated.',\n",

However, if the validation set is small, it will give a relatively noisy estimate of predictive performance. One solution to this dilemma is to use cross-validation, which is illustrated in Figure 1.18.

Then S −1 of the groups are used to train a set of models that are then evaluated on the re- maining group.

When data is particularly scarce, it may be appropriate to consider the case S = N, where N is the total number of data points, which gives the leave-one-out technique. One major drawback of cross-validation is that the number of training runs that must be performed is increased by a factor of S, and this can prove problematic for models in which the training is itself computationally expensive. A further problem with techniques such as cross-validation that use separate data to assess performance is that we might have multiple complexity parameters for a single model (for in- stance, there might be several regularization parameters). Exploring combinations of settings for such parameters could, in the worst case, require a number of training runs that is exponential in the number of parameters. Clearly, we need a better ap- proach. Ideally, this should rely only on the training data and should allow multiple hyperparameters and model types to be compared in a single training run.',\n",

We there- fore need to ﬁnd a measure of performance which depends only on the training data and which does not suffer from bias due to over-ﬁtting. Historically various ‘information criteria’ have been proposed that attempt to correct for the bias of maximum likelihood by the addition of a penalty term to compensate for the over-ﬁtting of more complex models. For example, the Akaike information criterion, or AIC (Akaike, 1974), chooses the model for which the quan- tity ln p(D|wML) −M (1.73) is largest. Here p(D|wML) is the best-ﬁt log likelihood, and M is the number of adjustable parameters in the model. A variant of this quantity, called the Bayesian information criterion, or BIC, will be discussed in Section 4.4.1. Such criteria do not take account of the uncertainty in the model parameters, however, and in practice they tend to favour overly simple models. We therefore turn in Section 3.4 to a fully Bayesian approach where we shall see how complexity penalties arise in a natural and principled way.1.4.

As we now discuss, this poses some serious challenges and is an important factor inﬂuencing the design of pattern recognition techniques. In order to illustrate the problem we consider a synthetically generated data set representing measurements taken from a pipeline containing a mixture of oil, wa- ter, and gas (Bishop and James, 1993). These three materials can be present in one of three different geometrical conﬁgurations known as ‘homogenous’, ‘annular’, and ‘laminar’, and the fractions of the three materials can also vary. Each data point com- prises a 12-dimensional input vector consisting of measurements taken with gamma ray densitometers that measure the attenuation of gamma rays passing along nar- row beams through the pipe. This data set is described in detail in Appendix A. Figure 1.19 shows 100 points from this data set on a plot showing two of the mea- surements x6 and x7 (the remaining ten input values are ignored for the purposes of this illustration). Each data point is labelled according to which of the three geomet- rical classes it belongs to, and our goal is to use this data as a training set in order to be able to classify a new observation (x6, x7), such as the one denoted by the cross in Figure 1.19. We observe that the cross is surrounded by numerous red points, and so we might suppose that it belongs to the red class.',\n",

The intuition here is that the identity of the cross should be determined more strongly by nearby points from the training set and less strongly by more distant points. In fact, this intuition turns out to be reasonable and will be discussed more fully in later chapters. How can we turn this intuition into a learning algorithm?One very simple ap- proach would be to divide the input space into regular cells, as indicated in Fig- ure 1.20.

There are numerous problems with this naive approach, but one of the most se- vere becomes apparent when we consider its extension to problems having larger numbers of input variables, corresponding to input spaces of higher dimensionality. The origin of the problem is illustrated in Figure 1.21, which shows that, if we divide a region of a space into regular cells, then the number of such cells grows exponen- tially with the dimensionality of the space. The problem with an exponentially large number of cells is that we would need an exponentially large quantity of training data in order to ensure that the cells are not empty. Clearly, we have no hope of applying such a technique in a space of more than a few variables, and so we need to ﬁnd a more sophisticated approach.

If we have D input variables, then a general polynomial with coefﬁcients up to order 3 would take the form y(x, w) = w0 + D \\x02 i=1 wixi + D \\x02 i=1 D \\x02 j=1 wijxixj + D \\x02 i=1 D \\x02 j=1 D \\x02 k=1 wijkxixjxk. (1.74) As D increases, so the number of independent coefﬁcients (not all of the coefﬁcients are independent due to interchange symmetries amongst the x variables) grows pro- portionally to D3. In practice, to capture complex dependencies in the data, we may need to use a higher-order polynomial. For a polynomial of order M, the growth in the number of coefﬁcients is like DM. Although this is now a power law growth, Exercise 1.16 rather than an exponential growth, it still points to the method becoming rapidly unwieldy and of limited practical utility. Our geometrical intuitions, formed through a life spent in a space of three di- mensions, can fail badly when we consider spaces of higher dimensionality. As a simple example, consider a sphere of radius r = 1 in a space of D dimensions, and ask what is the fraction of the volume of the sphere that lies between radius r = 1−ϵ and r = 1. We can evaluate this fraction by noting that the volume of a sphere of radius r in D dimensions must scale as rD, and so we write VD(r) = KDrD (1.75) where the constant KD depends only on D. Thus the required fraction is given by Exercise 1.18 VD(1) −VD(1 −ϵ) VD(1) = 1 −(1 −ϵ)D (1.76) which is plotted as a function of ϵ for various values of D in Figure 1.22. We see that, for large D, this fraction tends to 1 even for small values of ϵ. Thus, in spaces of high dimensionality, most of the volume of a sphere is concentrated in a thin shell near the surface!',\n",

If we transform from Cartesian to polar coordinates, and then integrate out the directional variables, we obtain an expression for the density p(r) as a function of radius r from the origin. Exercise 1.20 Thus p(r)δr is the probability mass inside a thin shell of thickness δr located at radius r. This distribution is plotted, for various values of D, in Figure 1.23, and we see that for large D the probability mass of the Gaussian is concentrated in a thin shell. The severe difﬁculty that can arise in spaces of many dimensions is sometimes called the curse of dimensionality (Bellman, 1961). In this book, we shall make ex- tensive use of illustrative examples involving input spaces of one or two dimensions, because this makes it particularly easy to illustrate the techniques graphically.

First, real data will often be conﬁned to a region of the space having lower effective dimension- ality, and in particular the directions over which important variations in the target variables occur may be so conﬁned. Second, real data will typically exhibit some smoothness properties (at least locally) so that for the most part small changes in the input variables will produce small changes in the target variables, and so we can ex- ploit local interpolation-like techniques to allow us to make predictions of the target variables for new values of the input variables. Successful pattern recognition tech- niques exploit one or both of these properties. Consider, for example, an application in manufacturing in which images are captured of identical planar objects on a con- veyor belt, in which the goal is to determine their orientation. Each image is a point Figure 1.23 Plot of the probability density with respect to radius r of a Gaus- sian distribution for various values of the dimensionality D.

Because the objects can occur at different positions within the image and in different orientations, there are three degrees of freedom of variability between images, and a set of images will live on a three dimensional manifold embedded within the high-dimensional space. Due to the complex relationships between the object position or orientation and the pixel intensities, this manifold will be highly nonlinear. If the goal is to learn a model that can take an input image and output the orientation of the object irrespective of its position, then there is only one degree of freedom of variability within the manifold that is signiﬁcant.1.5. Decision Theory We have seen in Section 1.2 how probability theory provides us with a consistent mathematical framework for quantifying and manipulating uncertainty. Here we turn to a discussion of decision theory that, when combined with probability theory, allows us to make optimal decisions in situations involving uncertainty such as those encountered in pattern recognition. Suppose we have an input vector x together with a corresponding vector t of target variables, and our goal is to predict t given a new value for x. For regression problems, t will comprise continuous variables, whereas for classiﬁcation problems t will represent class labels. The joint probability distribution p(x, t) provides a complete summary of the uncertainty associated with these variables. Determination of p(x, t) from a set of training data is an example of inference and is typically a very difﬁcult problem whose solution forms the subject of much of this book.',\n",

In a practical application, however, we must often make a speciﬁc prediction for the value of t, or more generally take a speciﬁc action based on our understanding of the values t is likely to take, and this aspect is the subject of decision theory. Consider, for example, a medical diagnosis problem in which we have taken an X-ray image of a patient, and we wish to determine whether the patient has cancer or not. In this case, the input vector x is the set of pixel intensities in the image, and output variable t will represent the presence of cancer, which we denote by the class C1, or the absence of cancer, which we denote by the class C2. We might, for instance, choose t to be a binary variable such that t = 0 corresponds to class C1 and t = 1 corresponds to class C2. We shall see later that this choice of label values is particularly convenient for probabilistic models. The general inference problem then involves determining the joint distribution p(x, Ck), or equivalently p(x, t), which gives us the most complete probabilistic description of the situation. Although this can be a very useful and informative quantity, in the end we must decide either to give treatment to the patient or not, and we would like this choice to be optimal in some appropriate sense (Duda and Hart, 1973). This is the decision step, and it is the subject of decision theory to tell us how to make optimal decisions given the appropriate probabilities. We shall see that the decision stage is generally very simple, even trivial, once we have solved the inference problem.

Before giving a more detailed analysis, let us ﬁrst consider informally how we might expect probabilities to play a role in making decisions. When we obtain the X-ray image x for a new patient, our goal is to decide which of the two classes to assign to the image. We are interested in the probabilities of the two classes given the image, which are given by p(Ck|x). Using Bayes’ theorem, these probabilities can be expressed in the form p(Ck|x) = p(x|Ck)p(Ck) p(x) . (1.77) Note that any of the quantities appearing in Bayes’ theorem can be obtained from the joint distribution p(x, Ck) by either marginalizing or conditioning with respect to the appropriate variables. We can now interpret p(Ck) as the prior probability for the class Ck, and p(Ck|x) as the corresponding posterior probability. Thus p(C1) repre- sents the probability that a person has cancer, before we take the X-ray measurement. Similarly, p(C1|x) is the corresponding probability, revised using Bayes’ theorem in light of the information contained in the X-ray.',\n",

We now show that this intuition is correct, and we also discuss more general criteria for making decisions.1.5.1 Minimizing the misclassiﬁcation rate Suppose that our goal is simply to make as few misclassiﬁcations as possible. We need a rule that assigns each value of x to one of the available classes. Such a rule will divide the input space into regions Rk called decision regions, one for each class, such that all points in Rk are assigned to class Ck. The boundaries between decision regions are called decision boundaries or decision surfaces. Note that each decision region need not be contiguous but could comprise some number of disjoint regions. We shall encounter examples of decision boundaries and decision regions in later chapters. In order to ﬁnd the optimal decision rule, consider ﬁrst of all the case of two classes, as in the cancer problem for instance.

Clearly to minimize p(mistake) we should arrange that each x is assigned to whichever class has the smaller value of the integrand in (1.78). Thus, if p(x, C1) > p(x, C2) for a given value of x, then we should assign that x to class C1. From the product rule of probability we have p(x, Ck) = p(Ck|x)p(x).

INTRODUCTION R1 R2 x0 \\x01x p(x, C1) p(x, C2) x Figure 1.24 Schematic illustration of the joint probabilities p(x, Ck) for each of two classes plotted against x, together with the decision boundary x = bx. Values of x ⩾bx are classiﬁed as class C2 and hence belong to decision region R2, whereas points x < bx are classiﬁed as C1 and belong to R1. Errors arise from the blue, green, and red regions, so that for x < bx the errors are due to points from class C2 being misclassiﬁed as C1 (represented by the sum of the red and green regions), and conversely for points in the region x ⩾bx the errors are due to points from class C1 being misclassiﬁed as C2 (represented by the blue region). As we vary the location bx of the decision boundary, the combined areas of the blue and green regions remains constant, whereas the size of the red region varies. The optimal choice for bx is where the curves for p(x, C1) and p(x, C2) cross, corresponding to bx = x0, because in this case the red region disappears. This is equivalent to the minimum misclassiﬁcation rate decision rule, which assigns each value of x to the class having the higher posterior probability p(Ck|x).probability of making a mistake is obtained if each value of x is assigned to the class for which the posterior probability p(Ck|x) is largest. This result is illustrated for two classes, and a single input variable x, in Figure 1.24. For the more general case of K classes, it is slightly easier to maximize the probability of being correct, which is given by p(correct) = K \\x02 k=1 p(x ∈Rk, Ck) = K \\x02 k=1 \\x06 Rk p(x, Ck) dx (1.79) which is maximized when the regions Rk are chosen such that each x is assigned to the class for which p(x, Ck) is largest. Again, using the product rule p(x, Ck) = p(Ck|x)p(x), and noting that the factor of p(x) is common to all terms, we see that each x should be assigned to the class having the largest posterior probability p(Ck|x).',\n",

Let us consider again the medical diagnosis problem. We note that, if a patient who does not have cancer is incorrectly diagnosed as having cancer, the consequences may be some patient distress plus the need for further investigations. Conversely, if a patient with cancer is diagnosed as healthy, the result may be premature death due to lack of treatment. Thus the consequences of these two types of mistake can be dramatically different. It would clearly be better to make fewer mistakes of the second kind, even if this was at the expense of making more mistakes of the ﬁrst kind. We can formalize such issues through the introduction of a loss function, also called a cost function, which is a single, overall measure of loss incurred in taking any of the available decisions or actions. Our goal is then to minimize the total loss incurred.',\n",

These are equivalent concepts if we take the utility to be simply the negative of the loss, and throughout this text we shall use the loss function convention. Suppose that, for a new value of x, the true class is Ck and that we assign x to class Cj (where j may or may not be equal to k). In so doing, we incur some level of loss that we denote by Lkj, which we can view as the k, j element of a loss matrix. For instance, in our cancer example, we might have a loss matrix of the form shown in Figure 1.25. This particular loss matrix says that there is no loss incurred if the correct decision is made, there is a loss of 1 if a healthy patient is diagnosed as having cancer, whereas there is a loss of 1000 if a patient having cancer is diagnosed as healthy. The optimal solution is the one which minimizes the loss function. However, the loss function depends on the true class, which is unknown. For a given input vector x, our uncertainty in the true class is expressed through the joint probability distribution p(x, Ck) and so we seek instead to minimize the average loss, where the average is computed with respect to this distribution, which is given by E[L] = \\x02 k \\x02 j \\x06 Rj Lkjp(x, Ck) dx.

These are the regions where we are relatively uncertain about class membership. In some applications, it will be appropriate to avoid making decisions on the difﬁcult cases in anticipation of a lower error rate on those examples for which a classiﬁcation de- cision is made. This is known as the reject option. For example, in our hypothetical medical illustration, it may be appropriate to use an automatic system to classify those X-ray images for which there is little doubt as to the correct class, while leav- ing a human expert to classify the more ambiguous cases. We can achieve this by introducing a threshold θ and rejecting those inputs x for which the largest of the posterior probabilities p(Ck|x) is less than or equal to θ.',\n",

An alternative possibility would be to solve both problems together and simply learn a function that maps inputs x directly into decisions. Such a function is called a discriminant function. In fact, we can identify three distinct approaches to solving decision problems, all of which have been used in practical applications. These are given, in decreasing order of complexity, by: (a) First solve the inference problem of determining the class-conditional densities p(x|Ck) for each class Ck individually. Also separately infer the prior class probabilities p(Ck). Then use Bayes’ theorem in the form p(Ck|x) = p(x|Ck)p(Ck) p(x) (1.82) to ﬁnd the posterior class probabilities p(Ck|x). As usual, the denominator in Bayes’ theorem can be found in terms of the quantities appearing in the numerator, because p(x) = \\x02 k p(x|Ck)p(Ck). (1.83) Equivalently, we can model the joint distribution p(x, Ck) directly and then normalize to obtain the posterior probabilities. Having found the posterior probabilities, we use decision theory to determine class membership for each new input x. Approaches that explicitly or implicitly model the distribution of inputs as well as outputs are known as generative models, because by sampling from them it is possible to generate synthetic data points in the input space.

Let us consider the relative merits of these three alternatives. Approach (a) is the most demanding because it involves ﬁnding the joint distribution over both x and Ck. For many applications, x will have high dimensionality, and consequently we may need a large training set in order to be able to determine the class-conditional densities to reasonable accuracy. Note that the class priors p(Ck) can often be esti- mated simply from the fractions of the training set data points in each of the classes.

However, if we only wish to make classiﬁcation decisions, then it can be waste- ful of computational resources, and excessively demanding of data, to ﬁnd the joint distribution p(x, Ck) when in fact we only really need the posterior probabilities p(Ck|x), which can be obtained directly through approach (b). Indeed, the class- conditional densities may contain a lot of structure that has little effect on the pos- terior probabilities, as illustrated in Figure 1.27. There has been much interest in exploring the relative merits of generative and discriminative approaches to machine learning, and in ﬁnding ways to combine them (Jebara, 2004; Lasserre et al.,2006). An even simpler approach is (c) in which we use the training data to ﬁnd a discriminant function f(x) that maps each x directly onto a class label, thereby combining the inference and decision stages into a single learning problem. In the example of Figure 1.27, this would correspond to ﬁnding the value of x shown by the vertical green line, because this is the decision boundary giving the minimum probability of misclassiﬁcation.',\n",

Posterior probabilities allow us to determine a rejection criterion that will minimize the misclassiﬁcation rate, or more generally the expected loss, for a given fraction of rejected data points. Compensating for class priors. Consider our medical X-ray problem again, and suppose that we have collected a large number of X-ray images from the gen- eral population for use as training data in order to build an automated screening system. Because cancer is rare amongst the general population, we might ﬁnd that, say, only 1 in every 1,000 examples corresponds to the presence of can- cer. If we used such a data set to train an adaptive model, we could run into severe difﬁculties due to the small proportion of the cancer class. For instance, a classiﬁer that assigned every point to the normal class would already achieve 99.9% accuracy and it would be difﬁcult to avoid this trivial solution.',\n",

A balanced data set in which we have selected equal numbers of exam- ples from each of the classes would allow us to ﬁnd a more accurate model. However, we then have to compensate for the effects of our modiﬁcations to the training data. Suppose we have used such a modiﬁed data set and found models for the posterior probabilities. From Bayes’ theorem (1.82), we see that the posterior probabilities are proportional to the prior probabilities, which we can interpret as the fractions of points in each class. We can therefore simply take the posterior probabilities obtained from our artiﬁcially balanced data set and ﬁrst divide by the class fractions in that data set and then multiply by the class fractions in the population to which we wish to apply the model. Finally, we need to normalize to ensure that the new posterior probabilities sum to one.

The posterior probability, given both the X-ray and blood data, is then given by p(Ck|xI, xB) ∝ p(xI, xB|Ck)p(Ck) ∝ p(xI|Ck)p(xB|Ck)p(Ck) ∝ p(Ck|xI)p(Ck|xB) p(Ck) (1.85) Thus we need the class prior probabilities p(Ck), which we can easily estimate from the fractions of data points in each class, and then we need to normalize the resulting posterior probabilities so they sum to one. The particular condi- tional independence assumption (1.84) is an example of the naive Bayes model. Section 8.2.2 Note that the joint marginal distribution p(xI, xB) will typically not factorize under this model. We shall see in later chapters how to construct models for combining data that do not require the conditional independence assumption (1.84).1.5.5 Loss functions for regression So far, we have discussed decision theory in the context of classiﬁcation prob- lems. We now turn to the case of regression problems, such as the curve ﬁtting example discussed earlier. The decision stage consists of choosing a speciﬁc esti- Section 1.1 mate y(x) of the value of t for each input x. Suppose that in doing so, we incur a loss L(t, y(x)).

This result is illustrated in Figure 1.28. It can readily be extended to mul- tiple target variables represented by the vector t, in which case the optimal solution is the conditional average y(x) = Et[t|x]. Exercise 1.25 We can also derive this result in a slightly different way, which will also shed light on the nature of the regression problem. Armed with the knowledge that the optimal solution is the conditional expectation, we can expand the square term as follows {y(x) −t}2 = {y(x) −E[t|x] + E[t|x] −t}2 = {y(x) −E[t|x]}2 + 2{y(x) −E[t|x]}{E[t|x] −t} + {E[t|x] −t}2 where, to keep the notation uncluttered, we use E[t|x] to denote Et[t|x]. Substituting into the loss function and performing the integral over t, we see that the cross-term vanishes and we obtain an expression for the loss function in the form E[L] = \\x06 {y(x) −E[t|x]}2 p(x) dx + \\x06 {E[t|x] −t}2p(x) dx. (1.90) The function y(x) we seek to determine enters only in the ﬁrst term, which will be minimized when y(x) is equal to E[t|x], in which case this term will vanish. This is simply the result that we derived previously and that shows that the optimal least squares predictor is given by the conditional mean.

(c) Find a regression function y(x) directly from the training data. The relative merits of these three approaches follow the same lines as for classiﬁca- tion problems above. The squared loss is not the only possible choice of loss function for regression. Indeed, there are situations in which squared loss can lead to very poor results and where we need to develop more sophisticated approaches. An important example concerns situations in which the conditional distribution p(t|x) is multimodal, as often arises in the solution of inverse problems. Here we consider brieﬂy one simple Section 5.6 generalization of the squared loss, called the Minkowski loss, whose expectation is given by E[Lq] = \\x06\\x06 |y(x) −t|qp(x, t) dx dt (1.91) which reduces to the expected squared loss for q = 2. The function |y −t|q is plotted against y −t for various values of q in Figure 1.29. The minimum of E[Lq] is given by the conditional mean for q = 2, the conditional median for q = 1, and the conditional mode for q →0. Exercise 1.27 1.6.',\n",

Information Theory In this chapter, we have discussed a variety of concepts from probability theory and decision theory that will form the foundations for much of the subsequent discussion in this book. We close this chapter by introducing some additional concepts from the ﬁeld of information theory, which will also prove useful in our development of pattern recognition and machine learning techniques. Again, we shall focus only on the key concepts, and we refer the reader elsewhere for more detailed discussions (Viterbi and Omura, 1979; Cover and Thomas, 1991; MacKay, 2003) . We begin by considering a discrete random variable x and we ask how much information is received when we observe a speciﬁc value for this variable. The amount of information can be viewed as the ‘degree of surprise’ on learning the value of x. If we are told that a highly improbable event has just occurred, we will have received more information than if we were told that some very likely event has just occurred, and if we knew that the event was certain to happen we would receive no information. Our measure of information content will therefore depend on the probability distribution p(x), and we therefore look for a quantity h(x) that is a monotonic function of the probability p(x) and that expresses the information content. The form of h(·) can be found by noting that if we have two events x and y that are unrelated, then the information gain from observing both of them should be the sum of the information gained from each of them separately, so that h(x, y) = h(x) + h(y). Two unrelated events will be statistically independent and so p(x, y) = p(x)p(y). From these two relationships, it is easily shown that h(x) must be given by the logarithm of p(x) and so we have Exercise 1.28',\n",

Note that low probability events x correspond to high information content. The choice of basis for the logarithm is arbitrary, and for the moment we shall adopt the convention prevalent in information theory of using logarithms to the base of 2. In this case, as we shall see shortly, the units of h(x) are bits (‘binary digits’). Now suppose that a sender wishes to transmit the value of a random variable to a receiver. The average amount of information that they transmit in the process is obtained by taking the expectation of (1.92) with respect to the distribution p(x) and is given by H[x] = − \\x02 x p(x) log2 p(x). (1.93) This important quantity is called the entropy of the random variable x.

Consider a random variable x having 8 possible states, each of which is equally likely. In order to communicate the value of x to a receiver, we would need to transmit a message of length 3 bits. Notice that the entropy of this variable is given by H[x] = −8 × 1 8 log2 1 8 = 3 bits. Now consider an example (Cover and Thomas, 1991) of a variable having 8 pos- sible states {a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h} for which the respective probabilities are given by ( 1 2, 1 4, 1 8, 1 16, 1 64, 1 64, 1 64, 1 64). The entropy in this case is given by H[x] = −1 2 log2 1 2 −1 4 log2 1 4 −1 8 log2 1 8 −1 16 log2 1 16 −4 64 log2 1 64 = 2 bits. We see that the nonuniform distribution has a smaller entropy than the uniform one, and we shall gain some insight into this shortly when we discuss the interpretation of entropy in terms of disorder. For the moment, let us consider how we would transmit the identity of the variable’s state to a receiver. We could do this, as before, using a 3-bit number.',\n",

       "  'sentence_chunk': 'We could do this, as before, using a 3-bit number. However, we can take advantage of the nonuniform distribution by using shorter codes for the more probable events, at the expense of longer codes for the less probable events, in the hope of getting a shorter average code length. This can be done by representing the states {a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h} using, for instance, the following set of code strings: 0, 10, 110, 1110, 111100, 111101, 111110, 111111. The average length of the code that has to be transmitted is then average code length = 1 2 × 1 + 1 4 × 2 + 1 8 × 3 + 1 16 × 4 + 4 × 1 64 × 6 = 2 bits which again is the same as the entropy of the random variable. Note that shorter code strings cannot be used because it must be possible to disambiguate a concatenation of such strings into its component parts. For instance, 11001110 decodes uniquely into the state sequence c, a, d. This relation between entropy and shortest coding length is a general one. The noiseless coding theorem (Shannon, 1948) states that the entropy is a lower bound on the number of bits needed to transmit the state of a random variable. From now on, we shall switch to the use of natural logarithms in deﬁning en- tropy, as this will provide a more convenient link with ideas elsewhere in this book. In this case, the entropy is measured in units of ‘nats’ instead of bits, which differ simply by a factor of ln 2. We have introduced the concept of entropy in terms of the average amount of information needed to specify the state of a random variable. In fact, the concept of entropy has much earlier origins in physics where it was introduced in the context of equilibrium thermodynamics and later given a deeper interpretation as a measure of disorder through developments in statistical mechanics.',\n",

The corresponding value of the entropy is then H = ln M. This result can also be derived from Jensen’s inequality (to be discussed shortly). To verify that the stationary point is indeed a maximum, we can Exercise 1.29 evaluate the second derivative of the entropy, which gives ∂\\x04H ∂p(xi)∂p(xj) = −Iij 1 pi (1.100) where Iij are the elements of the identity matrix. We can extend the deﬁnition of entropy to include distributions p(x) over con- tinuous variables x as follows. First divide x into bins of width ∆. Then, assuming p(x) is continuous, the mean value theorem (Weisstein, 1999) tells us that, for each such bin, there must exist a value xi such that \\x06 (i+1)∆ i∆ p(x) dx = p(xi)∆. (1.101) We can now quantize the continuous variable x by assigning any value x to the value xi whenever x falls in the ith bin. The probability of observing the value xi is then p(xi)∆. This gives a discrete distribution for which the entropy takes the form H∆= − \\x02 i p(xi)∆ln (p(xi)∆) = − \\x02 i p(xi)∆ln p(xi) −ln ∆ (1.102) where we have used \\x05 i p(xi)∆= 1, which follows from (1.101).

We see that the discrete and continuous forms of the entropy differ by a quantity ln ∆, which diverges in the limit ∆→0. This reﬂects the fact that to specify a continuous variable very precisely requires a large number of bits. For a density deﬁned over multiple continuous variables, denoted collectively by the vector x, the differential entropy is given by H[x] = − \\x06 p(x) ln p(x) dx. (1.104) In the case of discrete distributions, we saw that the maximum entropy con- ﬁguration corresponded to an equal distribution of probabilities across the possible states of the variable. Let us now consider the maximum entropy conﬁguration for a continuous variable.

This is expressed through the famous equation S = k ln W in which W represents the number of possible microstates in a macrostate, and k ≃1.38 × 10−23 (in units of Joules per Kelvin) is known as Boltzmann’s constant. Boltzmann’s ideas were disputed by many scientists of they day. One dif- ﬁculty they saw arose from the second law of thermo- dynamics, which states that the entropy of a closed system tends to increase with time. By contrast, at the microscopic level the classical Newtonian equa- tions of physics are reversible, and so they found it difﬁcult to see how the latter could explain the for- mer. They didn’t fully appreciate Boltzmann’s argu- ments, which were statistical in nature and which con- cluded not that entropy could never decrease over time but simply that with overwhelming probability it would generally increase. Boltzmann even had a long- running dispute with the editor of the leading German physics journal who refused to let him refer to atoms and molecules as anything other than convenient the- oretical constructs. The continued attacks on his work lead to bouts of depression, and eventually he com- mitted suicide.

Note that we did not constrain the distribution to be nonnegative when we maximized the entropy. However, because the resulting distribution is indeed nonnegative, we see with hindsight that such a constraint is not necessary. If we evaluate the differential entropy of the Gaussian, we obtain Exercise 1.35 H[x] = 1 2 \\x1a 1 + ln(2πσ2)\\x1b . (1.110) Thus we see again that the entropy increases as the distribution becomes broader, i.e., as σ2 increases. This result also shows that the differential entropy, unlike the discrete entropy, can be negative, because H(x) < 0 in (1.110) for σ2 < 1/(2πe). Suppose we have a joint distribution p(x, y) from which we draw pairs of values of x and y. If a value of x is already known, then the additional information needed to specify the corresponding value of y is given by −ln p(y|x).',\n",

It is easily seen, using the product rule, that the conditional entropy satisﬁes the relation Exercise 1.37 H[x, y] = H[y|x] + H[x] (1.112) where H[x, y] is the differential entropy of p(x, y) and H[x] is the differential en- tropy of the marginal distribution p(x). Thus the information needed to describe x and y is given by the sum of the information needed to describe x alone plus the additional information required to specify y given x. 1.6.1 Relative entropy and mutual information So far in this section, we have introduced a number of concepts from information theory, including the key notion of entropy. We now start to relate these ideas to pattern recognition. Consider some unknown distribution p(x), and suppose that we have modelled this using an approximating distribution q(x). If we use q(x) to construct a coding scheme for the purpose of transmitting values of x to a receiver, then the average additional amount of information (in nats) required to specify the value of x (assuming we choose an efﬁcient coding scheme) as a result of using q(x) instead of the true distribution p(x) is given by KL(p∥q) = − \\x06 p(x) ln q(x) dx − \\x0f − \\x06 p(x) ln p(x) dx \\x10 = − \\x06 p(x) ln \\x0cq(x) p(x) \\r dx. (1.113) This is known as the relative entropy or Kullback-Leibler divergence, or KL diver- gence (Kullback and Leibler, 1951), between the distributions p(x) and q(x). Note that it is not a symmetrical quantity, that is to say KL(p∥q) ̸≡KL(q∥p). We now show that the Kullback-Leibler divergence satisﬁes KL(p∥q) ⩾0 with equality if, and only if, p(x) = q(x). To do this we ﬁrst introduce the concept of convex functions.

INTRODUCTION Figure 1.31 A convex function f(x) is one for which ev- ery chord (shown in blue) lies on or above the function (shown in red).x a b xλ chord xλ f(x) and the corresponding value of the function is f (λa + (1 −λ)b). Convexity then implies f(λa + (1 −λ)b) ⩽λf(a) + (1 −λ)f(b). (1.114) This is equivalent to the requirement that the second derivative of the function be everywhere positive. Examples of convex functions are x ln x (for x > 0) and x2. A Exercise 1.36 function is called strictly convex if the equality is satisﬁed only for λ = 0 and λ = 1. If a function has the opposite property, namely that every chord lies on or below the function, it is called concave, with a corresponding deﬁnition for strictly concave. If a function f(x) is convex, then −f(x) will be concave. Using the technique of proof by induction, we can show from (1.114) that a Exercise 1.38 convex function f(x) satisﬁes f \\x16 M \\x02 i=1 λixi \\x17 ⩽ M \\x02 i=1 λif(xi) (1.115) where λi ⩾0 and \\x05 i λi = 1, for any set of points {xi}.

In fact, −ln x is a strictly convex function, so the equality will hold if, and only if, q(x) = p(x) for all x. Thus we can in- terpret the Kullback-Leibler divergence as a measure of the dissimilarity of the two distributions p(x) and q(x). We see that there is an intimate relationship between data compression and den- sity estimation (i.e., the problem of modelling an unknown probability distribution) because the most efﬁcient compression is achieved when we know the true distri- bution. If we use a distribution that is different from the true one, then we must necessarily have a less efﬁcient coding, and on average the additional information that must be transmitted is (at least) equal to the Kullback-Leibler divergence be- tween the two distributions. Suppose that data is being generated from an unknown distribution p(x) that we wish to model. We can try to approximate this distribution using some parametric distribution q(x|θ), governed by a set of adjustable parameters θ, for example a multivariate Gaussian. One way to determine θ is to minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence between p(x) and q(x|θ) with respect to θ. We cannot do this directly because we don’t know p(x). Suppose, however, that we have observed a ﬁnite set of training points xn, for n = 1, . . . ,N, drawn from p(x).',\n",

(1.119) The second term on the right-hand side of (1.119) is independent of θ, and the ﬁrst term is the negative log likelihood function for θ under the distribution q(x|θ) eval- uated using the training set. Thus we see that minimizing this Kullback-Leibler divergence is equivalent to maximizing the likelihood function. Now consider the joint distribution between two sets of variables x and y given by p(x, y). If the sets of variables are independent, then their joint distribution will factorize into the product of their marginals p(x, y) = p(x)p(y). If the variables are not independent, we can gain some idea of whether they are ‘close’ to being indepen- dent by considering the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the joint distribution and the product of the marginals, given by I[x, y] ≡ KL(p(x, y)∥p(x)p(y)) = − \\x06\\x06 p(x, y) ln \\x0fp(x)p(y) p(x, y) \\x10 dx dy (1.120) which is called the mutual information between the variables x and y.

From a Bayesian perspective, we can view p(x) as the prior distribution for x and p(x|y) as the posterior distribu- tion after we have observed new data y.

We turn now to an exploration of some particular examples of probability distributions and their properties. As well as be- ing of great interest in their own right, these distributions can form building blocks for more complex models and will be used extensively throughout the book. The distributions introduced in this chapter will also serve another important purpose, namely to provide us with the opportunity to discuss some key statistical concepts, such as Bayesian inference, in the context of simple models before we encounter them in more complex situations in later chapters. One role for the distributions discussed in this chapter is to model the prob- ability distribution p(x) of a random variable x, given a ﬁnite set x1, . . . ,xN of observations. This problem is known as density estimation. For the purposes of this chapter, we shall assume that the data points are independent and identically distributed.

PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS damentally ill-posed, because there are inﬁnitely many probability distributions that could have given rise to the observed ﬁnite data set. Indeed, any distribution p(x) that is nonzero at each of the data points x1, . . . ,xN is a potential candidate. The issue of choosing an appropriate distribution relates to the problem of model selec- tion that has already been encountered in the context of polynomial curve ﬁtting in Chapter 1 and that is a central issue in pattern recognition. We begin by considering the binomial and multinomial distributions for discrete random variables and the Gaussian distribution for continuous random variables. These are speciﬁc examples of parametric distributions, so-called because they are governed by a small number of adaptive parameters, such as the mean and variance in the case of a Gaussian for example. To apply such models to the problem of density estimation, we need a procedure for determining suitable values for the parameters, given an observed data set. In a frequentist treatment, we choose speciﬁc values for the parameters by optimizing some criterion, such as the likelihood function. By contrast, in a Bayesian treatment we introduce prior distributions over the parameters and then use Bayes’ theorem to compute the corresponding posterior distribution given the observed data. We shall see that an important role is played by conjugate priors, that lead to posterior distributions having the same functional form as the prior, and that there- fore lead to a greatly simpliﬁed Bayesian analysis.',\n",

For example, the conjugate prior for the parameters of the multinomial distribution is called the Dirichlet distribution, while the conjugate prior for the mean of a Gaussian is another Gaussian. All of these distributions are examples of the exponential family of distributions, which possess a number of important properties, and which will be discussed in some detail. One limitation of the parametric approach is that it assumes a speciﬁc functional form for the distribution, which may turn out to be inappropriate for a particular application. An alternative approach is given by nonparametric density estimation methods in which the form of the distribution typically depends on the size of the data set. Such models still contain parameters, but these control the model complexity rather than the form of the distribution. We end this chapter by considering three nonparametric methods based respectively on histograms, nearest-neighbours, and kernels.2.1. Binary Variables We begin by considering a single binary random variable x ∈{0, 1}. For example, x might describe the outcome of ﬂipping a coin, with x = 1 representing ‘heads’, and x = 0 representing ‘tails’.

It is easily veriﬁed that this distribution Exercise 2.1 is normalized and that it has mean and variance given by E[x] = µ (2.3) var[x] = µ(1 −µ). (2.4) Now suppose we have a data set D = {x1, . . . ,xN} of observed values of x.

Now suppose we ﬂip a coin, say, 3 times and happen to observe 3 heads. Then N = m = 3 and µML = 1.

Exercise 2.4 2.1.1 The beta distribution We have seen in (2.8) that the maximum likelihood setting for the parameter µ in the Bernoulli distribution, and hence in the binomial distribution, is given by the fraction of the observations in the data set having x = 1. As we have already noted, this can give severely over-ﬁtted results for small data sets. In order to develop a Bayesian treatment for this problem, we need to introduce a prior distribution p(µ) over the parameter µ. Here we consider a form of prior distribution that has a simple interpretation as well as some useful analytical properties. To motivate this prior, we note that the likelihood function takes the form of the product of factors of the form µx(1 −µ)1−x. If we choose a prior to be proportional to powers of µ and (1 −µ), then the posterior distribution, which is proportional to the product of the prior and the likelihood function, will have the same functional form as the prior. This property is called conjugacy and we will see several examples of it later in this chapter. We therefore choose a prior, called the beta distribution, given by Beta(µ|a, b) = Γ(a + b) Γ(a)Γ(b)µa−1(1 −µ)b−1 (2.13) where Γ(x) is the gamma function deﬁned by (1.141), and the coefﬁcient in (2.13) ensures that the beta distribution is normalized, so that Exercise 2.5 \\x06 1 0 Beta(µ|a, b) dµ = 1.

We see that (2.17) has the same functional dependence on µ as the prior distribution, reﬂecting the conjugacy properties of the prior with respect to the like- lihood function. Indeed, it is simply another beta distribution, and its normalization coefﬁcient can therefore be obtained by comparison with (2.13) to give p(µ|m, l, a, b) = Γ(m + a + l + b) Γ(m + a)Γ(l + b)µm+a−1(1 −µ)l+b−1. (2.18) We see that the effect of observing a data set of m observations of x = 1 and l observations of x = 0 has been to increase the value of a by m, and the value of b by l, in going from the prior distribution to the posterior distribution. This allows us to provide a simple interpretation of the hyperparameters a and b in the prior as an effective number of observations of x = 1 and x = 0, respectively. Note that a and b need not be integers. Furthermore, the posterior distribution can act as the prior if we subsequently observe additional data. To see this, we can imagine taking observations one at a time and after each observation updating the current posterior',\n",

At each stage, the posterior is a beta distribution with some total number of (prior and actual) observed values for x = 1 and x = 0 given by the parameters a and b. Incorporation of an additional observation of x = 1 simply corresponds to incrementing the value of a by 1, whereas for an observation of x = 0 we increment b by 1. Figure 2.3 illustrates one step in this process. We see that this sequential approach to learning arises naturally when we adopt a Bayesian viewpoint. It is independent of the choice of prior and of the likelihood function and depends only on the assumption of i.i.d.data. Sequential methods make use of observations one at a time, or in small batches, and then discard them before the next observations are used. They can be used, for example, in real-time learning scenarios where a steady stream of data is arriving, and predictions must be made before all of the data is seen.',\n",

Maximum likelihood methods can also be cast into a sequential framework. Section 2.3.5 If our goal is to predict, as best we can, the outcome of the next trial, then we must evaluate the predictive distribution of x, given the observed data set D.

For a ﬁnite data set, the posterior mean for µ always lies between the prior mean and the maximum likelihood estimate for µ corresponding to the relative frequencies of events given by (2.7). Exercise 2.7 From Figure 2.2, we see that as the number of observations increases, so the posterior distribution becomes more sharply peaked. This can also be seen from the result (2.16) for the variance of the beta distribution, in which we see that the variance goes to zero for a →∞or b →∞. In fact, we might wonder whether it is a general property of Bayesian learning that, as we observe more and more data, the uncertainty represented by the posterior distribution will steadily decrease. To address this, we can take a frequentist view of Bayesian learning and show that, on average, such a property does indeed hold. Consider a general Bayesian inference problem for a parameter θ for which we have observed a data set D, de- scribed by the joint distribution p(θ, D). The following result Exercise 2.8 Eθ[θ] = ED [Eθ[θ|D]] (2.21) where Eθ[θ] ≡ \\x06 p(θ)θ dθ (2.22) ED[Eθ[θ|D]] ≡ \\x06 \\x0c\\x06 θp(θ|D) dθ \\r p(D) dD (2.23) says that the posterior mean of θ, averaged over the distribution generating the data, is equal to the prior mean of θ. Similarly, we can show that varθ[θ] = ED [varθ[θ|D]] + varD [Eθ[θ|D]] . (2.24) The term on the left-hand side of (2.24) is the prior variance of θ. On the right- hand side, the ﬁrst term is the average posterior variance of θ, and the second term measures the variance in the posterior mean of θ.',\n",

Note, however, that this result only holds on average, and that for a particular observed data set it is possible for the posterior variance to be larger than the prior variance.2.2. Multinomial Variables Binary variables can be used to describe quantities that can take one of two possible values. Often, however, we encounter discrete variables that can take on one of K possible mutually exclusive states. Although there are various alternative ways to express such variables, we shall see shortly that a particularly convenient represen- tation is the 1-of-K scheme in which the variable is represented by a K-dimensional vector x in which one of the elements xk equals 1, and all remaining elements equal',\n",

The Gaussian Distribution The Gaussian, also known as the normal distribution, is a widely used model for the distribution of continuous variables. In the case of a single variable x, the Gaussian distribution can be written in the form N (x|µ, σ2) = 1 (2πσ2)1/2 exp \\x01 −1 2σ2(x −µ)2 \\x02 (2.42) where µ is the mean and σ2 is the variance.

The Gaussian distribution arises in many different contexts and can be motivated from a variety of different perspectives. For example, we have already seen that for Section 1.6 a single real variable, the distribution that maximizes the entropy is the Gaussian. This property applies also to the multivariate Gaussian.

For large N, this distribution tends to a Gaussian, as illustrated in Figure 2.6. In practice, the convergence to a Gaussian as N increases can be very rapid. One consequence of this result is that the binomial distribution (2.9), which is a distribution over m deﬁned by the sum of N observations of the random binary variable x, will tend to a Gaussian as N →∞(see Figure 2.1 for the case of N = 10).

One of his many contribu- tions was to show that least squares can be derived under the assumption of normally distributed errors. He also created an early formulation of non-Euclidean geometry (a self-consistent geometrical theory that vi- olates the axioms of Euclid) but was reluctant to dis- cuss it openly for fear that his reputation might suffer if it were seen that he believed in such a geometry.

The Gaussian distribution will be constant on surfaces in x-space for which this quadratic form is constant.

PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS Figure 2.8 Contours of constant probability density for a Gaussian distribution in two dimensions in which the covariance matrix is (a) of general form, (b) diagonal, in which the elliptical contours are aligned with the coordinate axes, and (c) proportional to the identity matrix, in which the contours are concentric circles.x1 x2 (a) x1 x2 (b) x1 x2 (c) therefore grows quadratically with D, and the computational task of manipulating and inverting large matrices can become prohibitive. One way to address this prob- lem is to use restricted forms of the covariance matrix. If we consider covariance matrices that are diagonal, so that Σ = diag(σ2 i ), we then have a total of 2D inde- pendent parameters in the density model. The corresponding contours of constant density are given by axis-aligned ellipsoids. We could further restrict the covariance matrix to be proportional to the identity matrix, Σ = σ2I, known as an isotropic co- variance, giving D + 1 independent parameters in the model and spherical surfaces of constant density. The three possibilities of general, diagonal, and isotropic covari- ance matrices are illustrated in Figure 2.8. Unfortunately, whereas such approaches limit the number of degrees of freedom in the distribution and make inversion of the covariance matrix a much faster operation, they also greatly restrict the form of the probability density and limit its ability to capture interesting correlations in the data. A further limitation of the Gaussian distribution is that it is intrinsically uni- modal (i.e., has a single maximum) and so is unable to provide a good approximation to multimodal distributions. Thus the Gaussian distribution can be both too ﬂexible, in the sense of having too many parameters, while also being too limited in the range of distributions that it can adequately represent.',\n",

We will see later that the introduc- tion of latent variables, also called hidden variables or unobserved variables, allows both of these problems to be addressed. In particular, a rich family of multimodal distributions is obtained by introducing discrete latent variables leading to mixtures of Gaussians, as discussed in Section 2.3.9. Similarly, the introduction of continuous latent variables, as described in Chapter 12, leads to models in which the number of free parameters can be controlled independently of the dimensionality D of the data space while still allowing the model to capture the dominant correlations in the data set. Indeed, these two approaches can be combined and further extended to derive a very rich set of hierarchical models that can be adapted to a broad range of prac- tical applications. For instance, the Gaussian version of the Markov random ﬁeld, Section 8.3 which is widely used as a probabilistic model of images, is a Gaussian distribution over the joint space of pixel intensities but rendered tractable through the imposition of considerable structure reﬂecting the spatial organization of the pixels. Similarly, the linear dynamical system, used to model time series data for applications such Section 13.3 as tracking, is also a joint Gaussian distribution over a potentially large number of observed and latent variables and again is tractable due to the structure imposed on the distribution.

The Gaussian Distribution 85 such complex distributions is that of probabilistic graphical models, which will form the subject of Chapter 8.2.3.1 Conditional Gaussian distributions An important property of the multivariate Gaussian distribution is that if two sets of variables are jointly Gaussian, then the conditional distribution of one set conditioned on the other is again Gaussian. Similarly, the marginal distribution of either set is also Gaussian. Consider ﬁrst the case of conditional distributions. Suppose x is a D-dimensional vector with Gaussian distribution N(x|µ, Σ) and that we partition x into two dis- joint subsets xa and xb. Without loss of generality, we can take xa to form the ﬁrst M components of x, with xb comprising the remaining D −M components, so that x = \\x0f xa xb \\x10 .

(2.67) Note that the symmetry ΣT = Σ of the covariance matrix implies that Σaa and Σbb are symmetric, while Σba = ΣT ab. In many situations, it will be convenient to work with the inverse of the covari- ance matrix Λ ≡Σ−1 (2.68) which is known as the precision matrix.

PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS evaluated from the joint distribution p(x) = p(xa, xb) simply by ﬁxing xb to the observed value and normalizing the resulting expression to obtain a valid probability distribution over xa. Instead of performing this normalization explicitly, we can obtain the solution more efﬁciently by considering the quadratic form in the exponent of the Gaussian distribution given by (2.44) and then reinstating the normalization coefﬁcient at the end of the calculation. If we make use of the partitioning (2.65), (2.66), and (2.69), we obtain −1 2(x −µ)TΣ−1(x −µ) = −1 2(xa −µa)TΛaa(xa −µa) −1 2(xa −µa)TΛab(xb −µb) −1 2(xb −µb)TΛba(xa −µa) −1 2(xb −µb)TΛbb(xb −µb). (2.70) We see that as a function of xa, this is again a quadratic form, and hence the cor- responding conditional distribution p(xa|xb) will be Gaussian. Because this distri- bution is completely characterized by its mean and its covariance, our goal will be to identify expressions for the mean and covariance of p(xa|xb) by inspection of (2.70). This is an example of a rather common operation associated with Gaussian distributions, sometimes called ‘completing the square’, in which we are given a quadratic form deﬁning the exponent terms in a Gaussian distribution, and we need to determine the corresponding mean and covariance. Such problems can be solved straightforwardly by noting that the exponent in a general Gaussian distribution N(x|µ, Σ) can be written −1 2(x −µ)TΣ−1(x −µ) = −1 2xTΣ−1x + xTΣ−1µ + const (2.71) where ‘const’ denotes terms which are independent of x, and we have made use of the symmetry of Σ. Thus if we take our general quadratic form and express it in the form given by the right-hand side of (2.71), then we can immediately equate the matrix of coefﬁcients entering the second order term in x to the inverse covariance matrix Σ−1 and the coefﬁcient of the linear term in x to Σ−1µ, from which we can obtain µ. Now let us apply this procedure to the conditional Gaussian distribution p(xa|xb) for which the quadratic form in the exponent is given by (2.70). We will denote the mean and covariance of this distribution by µa|b and Σa|b, respectively. Consider the functional dependence of (2.70) on xa in which xb is regarded as a constant. If we pick out all terms that are second order in xa, we have −1 2xT a Λaaxa (2.72) from which we can immediately conclude that the covariance (inverse precision) of p(xa|xb) is given by Σa|b = Λ−1 aa .

From our discussion of the general form (2.71), the coefﬁcient of xa in this expression must equal Σ−1 a|bµa|b and hence µa|b = Σa|b {Λaaµa −Λab(xb −µb)} = µa −Λ−1 aa Λab(xb −µb) (2.75) where we have made use of (2.73). The results (2.73) and (2.75) are expressed in terms of the partitioned precision matrix of the original joint distribution p(xa, xb). We can also express these results in terms of the corresponding partitioned covariance matrix. To do this, we make use of the following identity for the inverse of a partitioned matrix Exercise 2.24 \\x0f A B C D \\x10−1 = \\x0f M −MBD−1 −D−1CM D−1 + D−1CMBD−1 \\x10 (2.76) where we have deﬁned M = (A −BD−1C)−1. (2.77) The quantity M−1 is known as the Schur complement of the matrix on the left-hand side of (2.76) with respect to the submatrix D. Using the deﬁnition \\x0f Σaa Σab Σba Σbb \\x10−1 = \\x0f Λaa Λab Λba Λbb \\x10 (2.78) and making use of (2.76), we have Λaa = (Σaa −ΣabΣ−1 bb Σba)−1 (2.79) Λab = −(Σaa −ΣabΣ−1 bb Σba)−1ΣabΣ−1 bb .

(2.82) Comparing (2.73) and (2.82), we see that the conditional distribution p(xa|xb) takes a simpler form when expressed in terms of the partitioned precision matrix than when it is expressed in terms of the partitioned covariance matrix. Note that the mean of the conditional distribution p(xa|xb), given by (2.81), is a linear function of xb and that the covariance, given by (2.82), is independent of xa.

PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS 2.3.2 Marginal Gaussian distributions We have seen that if a joint distribution p(xa, xb) is Gaussian, then the condi- tional distribution p(xa|xb) will again be Gaussian. Now we turn to a discussion of the marginal distribution given by p(xa) = \\x06 p(xa, xb) dxb (2.83) which, as we shall see, is also Gaussian. Once again, our strategy for evaluating this distribution efﬁciently will be to focus on the quadratic form in the exponent of the joint distribution and thereby to identify the mean and covariance of the marginal distribution p(xa). The quadratic form for the joint distribution can be expressed, using the par- titioned precision matrix, in the form (2.70). Because our goal is to integrate out xb, this is most easily achieved by ﬁrst considering the terms involving xb and then completing the square in order to facilitate integration. Picking out just those terms that involve xb, we have −1 2xT b Λbbxb+xT b m = −1 2(xb−Λ−1 bb m)TΛbb(xb−Λ−1 bb m)+ 1 2mTΛ−1 bb m (2.84) where we have deﬁned m = Λbbµb −Λba(xa −µa). (2.85) We see that the dependence on xb has been cast into the standard quadratic form of a Gaussian distribution corresponding to the ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of (2.84), plus a term that does not depend on xb (but that does depend on xa). Thus, when we take the exponential of this quadratic form, we see that the integration over xb required by (2.83) will take the form \\x06 exp \\x0c −1 2(xb −Λ−1 bb m)TΛbb(xb −Λ−1 bb m) \\r dxb. (2.86) This integration is easily performed by noting that it is the integral over an unnor- malized Gaussian, and so the result will be the reciprocal of the normalization co- efﬁcient. We know from the form of the normalized Gaussian given by (2.43), that this coefﬁcient is independent of the mean and depends only on the determinant of the covariance matrix.',\n",

Again, by comparison with (2.71), we see that the covariance of the marginal distribution of p(xa) is given by Σa = (Λaa −ΛabΛ−1 bb Λba)−1. (2.88) Similarly, the mean is given by Σa(Λaa −ΛabΛ−1 bb Λba)µa = µa (2.89) where we have used (2.88). The covariance in (2.88) is expressed in terms of the partitioned precision matrix given by (2.69). We can rewrite this in terms of the corresponding partitioning of the covariance matrix given by (2.67), as we did for the conditional distribution. These partitioned matrices are related by \\x0f Λaa Λab Λba Λbb \\x10−1 = \\x0f Σaa Σab Σba Σbb \\x10 (2.90) Making use of (2.76), we then have Λaa −ΛabΛ−1 bb Λba \\x0b−1 = Σaa.

We wish to ﬁnd the marginal distribution p(y) and the conditional distribution p(x|y). This is a problem that will arise frequently in subsequent chapters, and it will prove convenient to derive the general results here. We shall take the marginal and conditional distributions to be p(x) = N x|µ, Λ−1\\x0b (2.99) p(y|x) = N y|Ax + b, L−1\\x0b (2.100) where µ, A, and b are parameters governing the means, and Λ and L are precision matrices. If x has dimensionality M and y has dimensionality D, then the matrix A has size D × M. First we ﬁnd an expression for the joint distribution over x and y. To do this, we deﬁne z = \\x0f x y \\x10 (2.101) and then consider the log of the joint distribution ln p(z) = ln p(x) + ln p(y|x) = −1 2(x −µ)TΛ(x −µ) −1 2(y −Ax −b)TL(y −Ax −b) + const (2.102) where ‘const’ denotes terms independent of x and y. As before, we see that this is a quadratic function of the components of z, and hence p(z) is Gaussian distribution.

(2.107) Making use of (2.105), we then obtain Exercise 2.30 E[z] = \\x0f µ Aµ + b \\x10 . (2.108) Next we ﬁnd an expression for the marginal distribution p(y) in which we have marginalized over x. Recall that the marginal distribution over a subset of the com- ponents of a Gaussian random vector takes a particularly simple form when ex- pressed in terms of the partitioned covariance matrix. Speciﬁcally, its mean and Section 2.3 covariance are given by (2.92) and (2.93), respectively. Making use of (2.105) and (2.108) we see that the mean and covariance of the marginal distribution p(y) are given by E[y] = Aµ + b (2.109) cov[y] = L−1 + AΛ−1AT. (2.110) A special case of this result is when A = I, in which case it reduces to the convolu- tion of two Gaussians, for which we see that the mean of the convolution is the sum of the mean of the two Gaussians, and the covariance of the convolution is the sum of their covariances. Finally, we seek an expression for the conditional p(x|y). Recall that the results for the conditional distribution are most easily expressed in terms of the partitioned precision matrix, using (2.73) and (2.75). Applying these results to (2.105) and Section 2.3 (2.108) we see that the conditional distribution p(x|y) has mean and covariance given by E[x|y] = (Λ + ATLA)−1 \\x1a ATL(y −b) + Λµ \\x1b (2.111) cov[x|y] = (Λ + ATLA)−1.

The simplest approach is to ignore the symmetry constraint and show that the resulting solution is symmetric as required. Exercise 2.34 Alternative derivations of this result, which impose the symmetry and positive deﬁ- niteness constraints explicitly, can be found in Magnus and Neudecker (1999). The result is as expected and takes the form ΣML = 1 N N \\x02 n=1 (xn −µML)(xn −µML)T (2.122) which involves µML because this is the result of a joint maximization with respect to µ and Σ. Note that the solution (2.121) for µML does not depend on ΣML, and so we can ﬁrst evaluate µML and then use this to evaluate ΣML. If we evaluate the expectations of the maximum likelihood solutions under the true distribution, we obtain the following results Exercise 2.35 E[µML] = µ (2.123) E[ΣML] = N −1 N Σ. (2.124) We see that the expectation of the maximum likelihood estimate for the mean is equal to the true mean. However, the maximum likelihood estimate for the covariance has an expectation that is less than the true value, and hence it is biased. We can correct this bias by deﬁning a different estimator \\x04Σ given by \\x04Σ = 1 N −1 N \\x02 n=1 (xn −µML)(xn −µML)T. (2.125) Clearly from (2.122) and (2.124), the expectation of \\x04Σ is equal to Σ. 2.3.5 Sequential estimation Our discussion of the maximum likelihood solution for the parameters of a Gaus- sian distribution provides a convenient opportunity to give a more general discussion of the topic of sequential estimation for maximum likelihood. Sequential methods allow data points to be processed one at a time and then discarded and are important for on-line applications, and also where large data sets are involved so that batch processing of all data points at once is infeasible.

(2.126) This result has a nice interpretation, as follows. After observing N −1 data points we have estimated µ by µ(N−1) ML . We now observe data point xN, and we obtain our revised estimate µ(N) ML by moving the old estimate a small amount, proportional to 1/N, in the direction of the ‘error signal’ (xN −µ(N−1) ML ). Note that, as N increases, so the contribution from successive data points gets smaller. The result (2.126) will clearly give the same answer as the batch result (2.121) because the two formulae are equivalent. However, we will not always be able to de- rive a sequential algorithm by this route, and so we seek a more general formulation of sequential learning, which leads us to the Robbins-Monro algorithm.

The Robbins-Monro procedure then deﬁnes a sequence of successive estimates of the root θ⋆given by θ(N) = θ(N−1) + aN−1z(θ(N−1)) (2.129) where z(θ(N)) is an observed value of z when θ takes the value θ(N). The coefﬁcients {aN} represent a sequence of positive numbers that satisfy the conditions lim N→∞aN = 0 (2.130) ∞ \\x02 N=1 aN = ∞ (2.131) ∞ \\x02 N=1 a2 N < ∞. (2.132) It can then be shown (Robbins and Monro, 1951; Fukunaga, 1990) that the sequence of estimates given by (2.129) does indeed converge to the root with probability one. Note that the ﬁrst condition (2.130) ensures that the successive corrections decrease in magnitude so that the process can converge to a limiting value. The second con- dition (2.131) is required to ensure that the algorithm does not converge short of the root, and the third condition (2.132) is needed to ensure that the accumulated noise has ﬁnite variance and hence does not spoil convergence. Now let us consider how a general maximum likelihood problem can be solved sequentially using the Robbins-Monro algorithm. By deﬁnition, the maximum like- lihood solution θML is a stationary point of the log likelihood function and hence satisﬁes ∂ ∂θ \\x18 1 N N \\x02 n=1 ln p(xn|θ) \\x19\\x07\\x07\\x07\\x07\\x07 θML = 0.

In this case, the random variable z corresponds to the derivative of the log likelihood function and is given by (x −µML)/σ2, and its expectation that deﬁnes the regression function is a straight line given by (µ −µML)/σ2. The root of the regres- sion function corresponds to the maximum like- lihood estimator µML.µ z p(z|µ) µML As a speciﬁc example, we consider once again the sequential estimation of the mean of a Gaussian distribution, in which case the parameter θ(N) is the estimate µ(N) ML of the mean of the Gaussian, and the random variable z is given by z = ∂ ∂µML ln p(x|µML, σ2) = 1 σ2 (x −µML). (2.136) Thus the distribution of z is Gaussian with mean µ −µML, as illustrated in Fig- ure 2.11. Substituting (2.136) into (2.135), we obtain the univariate form of (2.126), provided we choose the coefﬁcients aN to have the form aN = σ2/N. Note that although we have focussed on the case of a single variable, the same technique, together with the same restrictions (2.130)–(2.132) on the coefﬁcients aN, apply equally to the multivariate case (Blum, 1965).2.3.6 Bayesian inference for the Gaussian The maximum likelihood framework gave point estimates for the parameters µ and Σ. Now we develop a Bayesian treatment by introducing prior distributions over these parameters. Let us begin with a simple example in which we consider a single Gaussian random variable x. We shall suppose that the variance σ2 is known, and we consider the task of inferring the mean µ given a set of N observations X = {x1, . . . ,xN}.

(2.139) Simple manipulation involving completing the square in the exponent shows that the Exercise 2.38 posterior distribution is given by p(µ|X) = N µ|µN, σ2 N \\x0b (2.140) where µN = σ2 Nσ2 0 + σ2 µ0 + Nσ2 0 Nσ2 0 + σ2 µML (2.141) 1 σ2 N = 1 σ2 0 + N σ2 (2.142) in which µML is the maximum likelihood solution for µ given by the sample mean µML = 1 N N \\x02 n=1 xn.

First of all, we note that the mean of the posterior distribution given by (2.141) is a compromise between the prior mean µ0 and the maximum likelihood solution µML. If the number of observed data points N = 0, then (2.141) reduces to the prior mean as expected. For N →∞, the posterior mean is given by the maximum likelihood solution. Similarly, consider the result (2.142) for the variance of the posterior distribution. We see that this is most naturally expressed in terms of the inverse variance, which is called the precision. Furthermore, the precisions are additive, so that the precision of the posterior is given by the precision of the prior plus one contribution of the data precision from each of the observed data points.',\n",

The generalization of this result to the case of a D- dimensional Gaussian random variable x with known covariance and unknown mean is straightforward.

In fact, the Bayesian paradigm leads very naturally to a sequential view of the inference problem. To see this in the context of the inference of the mean of a Gaussian, we write the posterior distribution with the contribution from the ﬁnal data point xN separated out so that p(µ|D) ∝ \\x1f p(µ) N−1 \\x0e n=1 p(xn|µ)  p(xN|µ). (2.144) The term in square brackets is (up to a normalization coefﬁcient) just the posterior distribution after observing N −1 data points.

The gamma distribution has a ﬁnite integral if a > 0, Exercise 2.41 and the distribution itself is ﬁnite if a ⩾1. It is plotted, for various values of a and b, in Figure 2.13. The mean and variance of the gamma distribution are given by Exercise 2.42 E[λ] = a b (2.147) var[λ] = a b2 . (2.148) Consider a prior distribution Gam(λ|a0, b0).

Thus we can interpret the parameter a0 in the prior in terms of 2a0 ‘effective’ prior observations. Similarly, from (2.151) we see that the N data points contribute Nσ2 ML/2 to the parameter b, where σ2 ML is the variance, and so we can interpret the parameter b0 in the prior as arising from the 2a0 ‘effective’ prior observations having variance 2b0/(2a0) = b0/a0. Recall that we made an analogous interpretation for the Dirichlet prior. These distributions Section 2.2 are examples of the exponential family, and we shall see that the interpretation of a conjugate prior in terms of effective ﬁctitious data points is a general one for the exponential family of distributions. Instead of working with the precision, we can consider the variance itself. The conjugate prior in this case is called the inverse gamma distribution, although we shall not discuss this further because we will ﬁnd it more convenient to work with the precision. Now suppose that both the mean and the precision are unknown.

Note that this is not simply the product of an independent Gaussian prior over µ and a gamma prior over λ, because the precision of µ is a linear function of λ. Even if we chose a prior in which µ and λ were independent, the posterior distribution would exhibit a coupling between the precision of µ and the value of λ.',\n",

Outliers can arise in practical applications either because the process that generates the data corresponds to a distribution having a heavy tail or simply through mislabelled data. Robustness is also an important property for regression problems. Unsurprisingly, the least squares approach to regression does not exhibit robustness, because it cor- responds to maximum likelihood under a (conditional) Gaussian distribution.

One important case, which arises in practical applications, is that of periodic variables. An example of a periodic variable would be the wind direction at a particular geographical location. We might, for instance, measure values of wind direction on a number of days and wish to summarize this using a parametric distribution. Another example is calendar time, where we may be interested in modelling quantities that are believed to be periodic over 24 hours or over an annual cycle. Such quantities can conveniently be represented using an angular (polar) coordinate 0 ⩽θ < 2π. We might be tempted to treat periodic variables by choosing some direction as the origin and then applying a conventional distribution such as the Gaussian. Such an approach, however, would give results that were strongly dependent on the arbitrary choice of origin.',\n",

Let us consider the problem of evaluating the mean of a set of observations D = {θ1, . . . ,θN} of a periodic variable. From now on, we shall assume that θ is measured in radians. We have already seen that the simple average (θ1+· · ·+θN)/N will be strongly coordinate dependent.

Note that this distribution fails to capture the two clumps in the data and indeed places much of its probability mass in the central region between the clumps where the data are relatively sparse.

For completeness, we mention brieﬂy some alternative techniques for the con- struction of periodic distributions. The simplest approach is to use a histogram of observations in which the angular coordinate is divided into ﬁxed bins. This has the virtue of simplicity and ﬂexibility but also suffers from signiﬁcant limitations, as we shall see when we discuss histogram methods in more detail in Section 2.5. Another approach starts, like the von Mises distribution, from a Gaussian distribution over a Euclidean space but now marginalizes onto the unit circle rather than conditioning (Mardia and Jupp, 2000). However, this leads to more complex forms of distribution and will not be discussed further.',\n",

Finally, any valid distribution over the real axis (such as a Gaussian) can be turned into a periodic distribution by mapping succes- sive intervals of width 2π onto the periodic variable (0, 2π), which corresponds to ‘wrapping’ the real axis around unit circle. Again, the resulting distribution is more complex to handle than the von Mises distribution. One limitation of the von Mises distribution is that it is unimodal. By forming mixtures of von Mises distributions, we obtain a ﬂexible framework for modelling periodic variables that can handle multimodality. For an example of a machine learn- ing application that makes use of von Mises distributions, see Lawrence et al. (2002), and for extensions to modelling conditional densities for regression problems, see Bishop and Nabney (1996).2.3.9 Mixtures of Gaussians While the Gaussian distribution has some important analytical properties, it suf- fers from signiﬁcant limitations when it comes to modelling real data sets.

We see that the data set forms two dominant clumps, and that a simple Gaussian distribution is unable to capture this structure, whereas a linear superposition of two Gaussians gives a better characterization of the data set. Such superpositions, formed by taking linear combinations of more basic dis- tributions such as Gaussians, can be formulated as probabilistic models known as mixture distributions (McLachlan and Basford, 1988; McLachlan and Peel, 2000). In Figure 2.22 we see that a linear combination of Gaussians can give rise to very complex densities. By using a sufﬁcient number of Gaussians, and by adjusting their means and covariances as well as the coefﬁcients in the linear combination, almost any continuous density can be approximated to arbitrary accuracy. We therefore consider a superposition of K Gaussian densities of the form p(x) = K \\x02 k=1 πkN(x|µk, Σk) (2.188) which is called a mixture of Gaussians.

We immediately see that the situation is now much more complex than with a single Gaussian, due to the presence of the summation over k inside the logarithm. As a result, the maximum likelihood solution for the parameters no longer has a closed-form analytical solution. One approach to maxi- mizing the likelihood function is to use iterative numerical optimization techniques (Fletcher, 1987; Nocedal and Wright, 1999; Bishop and Nabney, 2008). Alterna- tively we can employ a powerful framework called expectation maximization, which will be discussed at length in Chapter 9.2.4.

Members of the exponential family have many important properties in com- mon, and it is illuminating to discuss these properties in some generality.

We do not need to store the entire data set itself but only the value of the sufﬁcient statistic. For the Bernoulli distribution, for example, the function u(x) is given just by x and so we need only keep the sum of the data points {xn}, whereas for the Gaussian u(x) = (x, x2)T, and so we should keep both the sum of {xn} and the sum of {x2 n}. If we consider the limit N →∞, then the right-hand side of (2.228) becomes E[u(x)], and so by comparing with (2.226) we see that in this limit ηML will equal the true value η. In fact, this sufﬁciency property holds also for Bayesian inference, although we shall defer discussion of this until Chapter 8 when we have equipped ourselves with the tools of graphical models and can thereby gain a deeper insight into these important concepts.2.4.2 Conjugate priors We have already encountered the concept of a conjugate prior several times, for example in the context of the Bernoulli distribution (for which the conjugate prior is the beta distribution) or the Gaussian (where the conjugate prior for the mean is a Gaussian, and the conjugate prior for the precision is the Wishart distribution). In general, for a given probability distribution p(x|η), we can seek a prior p(η) that is conjugate to the likelihood function, so that the posterior distribution has the same functional form as the prior. For any member of the exponential family (2.194), there exists a conjugate prior that can be written in the form p(η|χ, ν) = f(χ, ν)g(η)ν exp \\x1a νηTχ \\x1b (2.229) where f(χ, ν) is a normalization coefﬁcient, and g(η) is the same function as ap- pears in (2.194). To see that this is indeed conjugate, let us multiply the prior (2.229) by the likelihood function (2.227) to obtain the posterior distribution, up to a nor- malization coefﬁcient, in the form p(η|X, χ, ν) ∝g(η)ν+N exp \\x18 ηT \\x16 N \\x02 n=1 u(xn) + νχ \\x17\\x19 .

We may then seek a form of prior distribution, called a noninformative prior, which is intended to have as little inﬂu- ence on the posterior distribution as possible (Jeffries, 1946; Box and Tao, 1973; Bernardo and Smith, 1994). This is sometimes referred to as ‘letting the data speak for themselves’. If we have a distribution p(x|λ) governed by a parameter λ, we might be tempted to propose a prior distribution p(λ) = const as a suitable prior. If λ is a discrete variable with K states, this simply amounts to setting the prior probability of each state to 1/K. In the case of continuous parameters, however, there are two potential difﬁculties with this approach. The ﬁrst is that, if the domain of λ is unbounded, this prior distribution cannot be correctly normalized because the integral over λ diverges. Such priors are called improper. In practice, improper priors can often be used provided the corresponding posterior distribution is proper, i.e., that it can be correctly normalized. For instance, if we put a uniform prior distribution over the mean of a Gaussian, then the posterior distribution for the mean, once we have observed at least one data point, will be proper.',\n",

A second difﬁculty arises from the transformation behaviour of a probability density under a nonlinear change of variables, given by (1.27). If a function h(λ) is constant, and we change variables to λ = η2, then \\x01h(η) = h(η2) will also be constant. However, if we choose the density pλ(λ) to be constant, then the density of η will be given, from (1.27), by pη(η) = pλ(λ) \\x07\\x07\\x07\\x07 dλ dη \\x07\\x07\\x07\\x07 = pλ(η2)2η ∝η (2.231) and so the density over η will not be constant. This issue does not arise when we use maximum likelihood, because the likelihood function p(x|λ) is a simple function of λ and so we are free to use any convenient parameterization. If, however, we are to choose a prior distribution that is constant, we must take care to use an appropriate representation for the parameters. Here we consider two simple examples of noninformative priors (Berger, 1985). First of all, if a density takes the form p(x|µ) = f(x −µ) (2.232) then the parameter µ is known as a location parameter. This family of densities exhibits translation invariance because if we shift x by a constant to give \\x01x = x + c, then p(\\x01x|\\x01µ) = f(\\x01x −\\x01µ) (2.233) where we have deﬁned \\x01µ = µ + c. Thus the density takes the same form in the new variable as in the original one, and so the density is independent of the choice of origin. We would like to choose a prior distribution that reﬂects this translation invariance property, and so we choose a prior that assigns equal probability mass to',\n",

An example of a location parameter would be the mean µ of a Gaussian distribution. As we have seen, the conjugate prior distri- bution for µ in this case is a Gaussian p(µ|µ0, σ2 0) = N(µ|µ0, σ2 0), and we obtain a noninformative prior by taking the limit σ2 0 →∞. Indeed, from (2.141) and (2.142) we see that this gives a posterior distribution over µ in which the contributions from the prior vanish. As a second example, consider a density of the form p(x|σ) = 1 σ f \\x11x σ \\x12 (2.236) where σ > 0. Note that this will be a normalized density provided f(x) is correctly normalized. The parameter σ is known as a scale parameter, and the density exhibits Exercise 2.59 scale invariance because if we scale x by a constant to give \\x01x = cx, then p(\\x01x|\\x01σ) = 1 \\x01σ f \\x0f\\x01x \\x01σ \\x10 (2.237) where we have deﬁned \\x01σ = cσ.

It is sometimes also convenient to think of the prior distribution for a scale parameter in terms of the density of the log of the parameter. Using the transformation rule (1.27) for densities we see that p(ln σ) = const.

As discussed earlier, it is often more convenient to work in terms of the precision λ = 1/σ2 rather than σ itself. Using the transformation rule for densities, we see that a distribution p(σ) ∝1/σ corresponds to a distribution over λ of the form p(λ) ∝1/λ. We have seen that the conjugate prior for λ was the gamma distribution Gam(λ|a0, b0) given by (2.146). The noninformative prior is obtained Section 2.3 as the special case a0 = b0 = 0. Again, if we examine the results (2.150) and (2.151) for the posterior distribution of λ, we see that for a0 = b0 = 0, the posterior depends only on terms arising from the data and not from the prior.2.5. Nonparametric Methods Throughout this chapter, we have focussed on the use of probability distributions having speciﬁc functional forms governed by a small number of parameters whose values are to be determined from a data set. This is called the parametric approach to density modelling. An important limitation of this approach is that the chosen density might be a poor model of the distribution that generates the data, which can result in poor predictive performance. For instance, if the process that generates the data is multimodal, then this aspect of the distribution can never be captured by a Gaussian, which is necessarily unimodal.',\n",

In this ﬁnal section, we consider some nonparametric approaches to density es- timation that make few assumptions about the form of the distribution. Here we shall focus mainly on simple frequentist methods. The reader should be aware, however, that nonparametric Bayesian methods are attracting increasing interest (Walker et al.,1999; Neal, 2000; M¨uller and Quintana, 2004; Teh et al.,2006). Let us start with a discussion of histogram methods for density estimation, which we have already encountered in the context of marginal and conditional distributions in Figure 1.11 and in the context of the central limit theorem in Figure 2.6. Here we explore the properties of histogram density models in more detail, focussing on the case of a single continuous variable x. Standard histograms simply partition x into distinct bins of width ∆i and then count the number ni of observations of x falling in bin i. In order to turn this count into a normalized probability density, we simply divide by the total number N of observations and by the width ∆i of the bins to obtain probability values for each bin given by pi = ni N∆i (2.241) for which it is easily seen that \\x1c p(x) dx = 1. This gives a model for the density p(x) that is constant over the width of each bin, and often the bins are chosen to have the same width ∆i = ∆.',\n",

Here the data is drawn from the distribution, corresponding to the green curve, which is formed from a mixture of two Gaussians. Also shown are three examples of his- togram density estimates corresponding to three different choices for the bin width ∆. We see that when ∆is very small (top ﬁgure), the resulting density model is very spiky, with a lot of structure that is not present in the underlying distribution that generated the data set. Conversely, if ∆is too large (bottom ﬁgure) then the result is a model that is too smooth and that consequently fails to capture the bimodal prop- erty of the green curve. The best results are obtained for some intermediate value of ∆(middle ﬁgure). In principle, a histogram density model is also dependent on the choice of edge location for the bins, though this is typically much less signiﬁcant than the value of ∆. Note that the histogram method has the property (unlike the methods to be dis- cussed shortly) that, once the histogram has been computed, the data set itself can be discarded, which can be advantageous if the data set is large. Also, the histogram approach is easily applied if the data points are arriving sequentially. In practice, the histogram technique can be useful for obtaining a quick visual- ization of data in one or two dimensions but is unsuited to most density estimation applications. One obvious problem is that the estimated density has discontinuities that are due to the bin edges rather than any property of the underlying distribution that generated the data.',\n",

This exponential scaling with D is an example of the curse of dimensionality. In a space of high dimensional- Section 1.4 ity, the quantity of data needed to provide meaningful estimates of local probability density would be prohibitive. The histogram approach to density estimation does, however, teach us two im- portant lessons. First, to estimate the probability density at a particular location, we should consider the data points that lie within some local neighbourhood of that point.

PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS this neighbourhood property was deﬁned by the bins, and there is a natural ‘smooth- ing’ parameter describing the spatial extent of the local region, in this case the bin width. Second, the value of the smoothing parameter should be neither too large nor too small in order to obtain good results. This is reminiscent of the choice of model complexity in polynomial curve ﬁtting discussed in Chapter 1 where the degree M of the polynomial, or alternatively the value α of the regularization parameter, was optimal for some intermediate value, neither too large nor too small. Armed with these insights, we turn now to a discussion of two widely used nonparametric tech- niques for density estimation, kernel estimators and nearest neighbours, which have better scaling with dimensionality than the simple histogram model.2.5.1 Kernel density estimators Let us suppose that observations are being drawn from some unknown probabil- ity density p(x) in some D-dimensional space, which we shall take to be Euclidean, and we wish to estimate the value of p(x). From our earlier discussion of locality, let us consider some small region R containing x. The probability mass associated with this region is given by P = \\x06 R p(x) dx. (2.242) Now suppose that we have collected a data set comprising N observations drawn from p(x). Because each data point has a probability P of falling within R, the total number K of points that lie inside R will be distributed according to the binomial distribution Section 2.1 Bin(K|N, P) = N!K!(N −K)!P K(1 −P)1−K. (2.243) Using (2.11), we see that the mean fraction of points falling inside the region is E[K/N] = P, and similarly using (2.12) we see that the variance around this mean is var[K/N] = P(1 −P)/N. For large N, this distribution will be sharply peaked around the mean and so K ≃NP. (2.244) If, however, we also assume that the region R is sufﬁciently small that the probability density p(x) is roughly constant over the region, then we have P ≃p(x)V (2.245) where V is the volume of R. Combining (2.244) and (2.245), we obtain our density estimate in the form p(x) = K NV . (',\n",

Combining (2.244) and (2.245), we obtain our density estimate in the form p(x) = K NV . (2.246) Note that the validity of (2.246) depends on two contradictory assumptions, namely that the region R be sufﬁciently small that the density is approximately constant over the region and yet sufﬁciently large (in relation to the value of that density) that the number K of points falling inside the region is sufﬁcient for the binomial distribution to be sharply peaked.',\n",

Either we can ﬁx K and determine the value of V from the data, which gives rise to the K-nearest-neighbour technique discussed shortly, or we can ﬁx V and determine K from the data, giv- ing rise to the kernel approach. It can be shown that both the K-nearest-neighbour density estimator and the kernel density estimator converge to the true probability density in the limit N →∞provided V shrinks suitably with N, and K grows with N (Duda and Hart, 1973). We begin by discussing the kernel method in detail, and to start with we take the region R to be a small hypercube centred on the point x at which we wish to determine the probability density. In order to count the number K of points falling within this region, it is convenient to deﬁne the following function k(u) = \\x0c 1, |ui| ⩽1/2, i = 1, . . . ,D, 0, otherwise (2.247) which represents a unit cube centred on the origin. The function k(u) is an example of a kernel function, and in this context is also called a Parzen window. From (2.247), the quantity k((x −xn)/h) will be one if the data point xn lies inside a cube of side h centred on x, and zero otherwise. The total number of data points lying inside this cube will therefore be K = N \\x02 n=1 k \\x11x −xn h \\x12 .

Using the symmetry of the function k(u), we can now re-interpret this equation, not as a single cube centred on x but as the sum over N cubes centred on the N data points xn. As it stands, the kernel density estimator (2.249) will suffer from one of the same problems that the histogram method suffered from, namely the presence of artiﬁcial discontinuities, in this case at the boundaries of the cubes. We can obtain a smoother density model if we choose a smoother kernel function, and a common choice is the Gaussian, which gives rise to the following kernel density model p(x) = 1 N N \\x02 n=1 1 (2πh2)1/2 exp \\x0c −∥x −xn∥2 2h2 \\r (2.250) where h represents the standard deviation of the Gaussian components. Thus our density model is obtained by placing a Gaussian over each data point and then adding up the contributions over the whole data set, and then dividing by N so that the den- sity is correctly normalized.

PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS Figure 2.25 Illustration of the kernel density model (2.250) applied to the same data set used to demonstrate the histogram approach in Figure 2.24.

We see that, as expected, the parameter h plays the role of a smoothing parameter, and there is a trade-off between sensitivity to noise at small h and over-smoothing at large h. Again, the optimization of h is a problem in model complexity, analogous to the choice of bin width in histogram density estimation, or the degree of the polynomial used in curve ﬁtting. We can choose any other kernel function k(u) in (2.249) subject to the condi- tions k(u) ⩾ 0, (2.251) \\x06 k(u) du = 1 (2.252) which ensure that the resulting probability distribution is nonnegative everywhere and integrates to one. The class of density model given by (2.249) is called a kernel density estimator, or Parzen estimator. It has a great merit that there is no compu- tation involved in the ‘training’ phase because this simply requires storage of the training set. However, this is also one of its great weaknesses because the computa- tional cost of evaluating the density grows linearly with the size of the data set.2.5.2 Nearest-neighbour methods One of the difﬁculties with the kernel approach to density estimation is that the parameter h governing the kernel width is ﬁxed for all kernels.',\n",

However, reducing h may lead to noisy estimates elsewhere in data space where the density is smaller. Thus the optimal choice for h may be dependent on location within the data space. This issue is addressed by nearest-neighbour methods for density estimation. We therefore return to our general result (2.246) for local density estimation, and instead of ﬁxing V and determining the value of K from the data, we consider a ﬁxed value of K and use the data to ﬁnd an appropriate value for V .

As discussed so far, both the K-nearest-neighbour method, and the kernel den- sity estimator, require the entire training data set to be stored, leading to expensive computation if the data set is large. This effect can be offset, at the expense of some additional one-off computation, by constructing tree-based search structures to allow (approximate) near neighbours to be found efﬁciently without doing an exhaustive search of the data set. Nevertheless, these nonparametric methods are still severely limited. On the other hand, we have seen that simple parametric models are very restricted in terms of the forms of distribution that they can represent. We therefore need to ﬁnd density models that are very ﬂexible and yet for which the complexity of the models can be controlled independently of the size of the training set, and we shall see in subsequent chapters how to achieve this.

We turn now to a discussion of super- vised learning, starting with regression. The goal of regression is to predict the value of one or more continuous target variables t given the value of a D-dimensional vec- tor x of input variables. We have already encountered an example of a regression problem when we considered polynomial curve ﬁtting in Chapter 1. The polynomial is a speciﬁc example of a broad class of functions called linear regression models, which share the property of being linear functions of the adjustable parameters, and which will form the focus of this chapter. The simplest form of linear regression models are also linear functions of the input variables. However, we can obtain a much more useful class of functions by taking linear combinations of a ﬁxed set of nonlinear functions of the input variables, known as basis functions. Such models are linear functions of the parameters, which gives them simple analytical properties, and yet can be nonlinear with respect to the input variables.137',\n",

LINEAR MODELS FOR REGRESSION Given a training data set comprising N observations {xn}, where n = 1, . . . ,N, together with corresponding target values {tn}, the goal is to predict the value of t for a new value of x. In the simplest approach, this can be done by directly con- structing an appropriate function y(x) whose values for new inputs x constitute the predictions for the corresponding values of t. More generally, from a probabilistic perspective, we aim to model the predictive distribution p(t|x) because this expresses our uncertainty about the value of t for each value of x. From this conditional dis- tribution we can make predictions of t, for any new value of x, in such a way as to minimize the expected value of a suitably chosen loss function. As discussed in Sec- tion 1.5.5, a common choice of loss function for real-valued variables is the squared loss, for which the optimal solution is given by the conditional expectation of t. Although linear models have signiﬁcant limitations as practical techniques for pattern recognition, particularly for problems involving input spaces of high dimen- sionality, they have nice analytical properties and form the foundation for more so- phisticated models to be discussed in later chapters.3.1. Linear Basis Function Models The simplest linear model for regression is one that involves a linear combination of the input variables y(x, w) = w0 + w1x1 + . . .+ wDxD (3.1) where x = (x1, . . . ,xD)T. This is often simply known as linear regression. The key property of this model is that it is a linear function of the parameters w0, . . . ,wD. It is also, however, a linear function of the input variables xi, and this imposes signiﬁcant limitations on the model. We therefore extend the class of models by considering linear combinations of ﬁxed nonlinear functions of the input variables, of the form y(x, w) = w0 + M−1 \\x02 j=1 wjφj(x) (3.2) where φj(x) are known as basis functions.',\n",

By denoting the maximum value of the index j by M −1, the total number of parameters in this model will be M. The parameter w0 allows for any ﬁxed offset in the data and is sometimes called a bias parameter (not to be confused with ‘bias’ in a statistical sense). It is often convenient to deﬁne an additional dummy ‘basis function’ φ0(x) = 1 so that y(x, w) = M−1 \\x02 j=0 wjφj(x) = wTφ(x) (3.3) where w = (w0, . . . ,wM−1)T and φ = (φ0, . . . ,φM−1)T.

If the original variables com- prise the vector x, then the features can be expressed in terms of the basis functions {φj(x)}. By using nonlinear basis functions, we allow the function y(x, w) to be a non- linear function of the input vector x. Functions of the form (3.2) are called linear models, however, because this function is linear in w. It is this linearity in the pa- rameters that will greatly simplify the analysis of this class of models. However, it also leads to some signiﬁcant limitations, as we discuss in Section 3.6. The example of polynomial regression considered in Chapter 1 is a particular example of this model in which there is a single input variable x, and the basis func- tions take the form of powers of x so that φj(x) = xj. One limitation of polynomial basis functions is that they are global functions of the input variable, so that changes in one region of input space affect all other regions. This can be resolved by dividing the input space up into regions and ﬁt a different polynomial in each region, leading to spline functions (Hastie et al.,2001). There are many other possible choices for the basis functions, for example φj(x) = exp \\x0c −(x −µj)2 2s2 \\r (3.4) where the µj govern the locations of the basis functions in input space, and the pa- rameter s governs their spatial scale.

(3.6) Equivalently, we can use the ‘tanh’ function because this is related to the logistic sigmoid by tanh(a) = 2σ(a) −1, and so a general linear combination of logistic sigmoid functions is equivalent to a general linear combination of ‘tanh’ functions. These various choices of basis function are illustrated in Figure 3.1. Yet another possible choice of basis function is the Fourier basis, which leads to an expansion in sinusoidal functions. Each basis function represents a speciﬁc fre- quency and has inﬁnite spatial extent. By contrast, basis functions that are localized to ﬁnite regions of input space necessarily comprise a spectrum of different spatial frequencies. In many signal processing applications, it is of interest to consider ba- sis functions that are localized in both space and frequency, leading to a class of functions known as wavelets. These are also deﬁned to be mutually orthogonal, to simplify their application. Wavelets are most applicable when the input values live',\n",

Useful texts on wavelets include Ogden (1997), Mallat (1999), and Vidakovic (1999). Most of the discussion in this chapter, however, is independent of the particular choice of basis function set, and so for most of our discussion we shall not specify the particular form of the basis functions, except for the purposes of numerical il- lustration. Indeed, much of our discussion will be equally applicable to the situation in which the vector φ(x) of basis functions is simply the identity φ(x) = x. Fur- thermore, in order to keep the notation simple, we shall focus on the case of a single target variable t. However, in Section 3.1.5, we consider brieﬂy the modiﬁcations needed to deal with multiple target variables.3.1.1 Maximum likelihood and least squares In Chapter 1, we ﬁtted polynomial functions to data sets by minimizing a sum- of-squares error function. We also showed that this error function could be motivated as the maximum likelihood solution under an assumed Gaussian noise model. Let us return to this discussion and consider the least squares approach, and its relation to maximum likelihood, in more detail. As before, we assume that the target variable t is given by a deterministic func- tion y(x, w) with additive Gaussian noise so that t = y(x, w) + ϵ (3.7) where ϵ is a zero mean Gaussian random variable with precision (inverse variance) β. Thus we can write p(t|x, w, β) = N(t|y(x, w), β−1). (',\n",

(3.9) Note that the Gaussian noise assumption implies that the conditional distribution of t given x is unimodal, which may be inappropriate for some applications. An ex- tension to mixtures of conditional Gaussian distributions, which permit multimodal conditional distributions, will be discussed in Section 14.5.1. Now consider a data set of inputs X = {x1, . . . ,xN} with corresponding target values t1, . . . ,tN. We group the target variables {tn} into a column vector that we denote by t where the typeface is chosen to distinguish it from a single observation of a multivariate target, which would be denoted t. Making the assumption that these data points are drawn independently from the distribution (3.8), we obtain the following expression for the likelihood function, which is a function of the adjustable parameters w and β, in the form p(t|X, w, β) = N \\x0e n=1 N(tn|wTφ(xn), β−1) (3.10) where we have used (3.3). Note that in supervised learning problems such as regres- sion (and classiﬁcation), we are not seeking to model the distribution of the input variables. Thus x will always appear in the set of conditioning variables, and so from now on we will drop the explicit x from expressions such as p(t|x, w, β) in or- der to keep the notation uncluttered.

It can be regarded as a generalization of the notion of matrix inverse to nonsquare matrices. Indeed, if Φ is square and invertible, then using the property (AB)−1 = B−1A−1 we see that Φ† ≡Φ−1.

Linear Basis Function Models 143 Figure 3.2 Geometrical interpretation of the least-squares solution, in an N-dimensional space whose axes are the values of t1, . . . ,tN. The least-squares regression function is obtained by ﬁnding the or- thogonal projection of the data vector t onto the subspace spanned by the basis functions φj(x) in which each basis function is viewed as a vec- tor ϕj of length N with elements φj(xn). S t y ϕ1 ϕ2 and so we see that the inverse of the noise precision is given by the residual variance of the target values around the regression function.3.1.2 Geometry of least squares At this point, it is instructive to consider the geometrical interpretation of the least-squares solution. To do this we consider an N-dimensional space whose axes are given by the tn, so that t = (t1, . . . ,tN)T is a vector in this space. Each basis function φj(xn), evaluated at the N data points, can also be represented as a vector in the same space, denoted by ϕj, as illustrated in Figure 3.2. Note that ϕj corresponds to the jth column of Φ, whereas φ(xn) corresponds to the nth row of Φ. If the number M of basis functions is smaller than the number N of data points, then the M vectors φj(xn) will span a linear subspace S of dimensionality M. We deﬁne y to be an N-dimensional vector whose nth element is given by y(xn, w), where n = 1, . . . ,N. Because y is an arbitrary linear combination of the vectors ϕj, it can live anywhere in the M-dimensional subspace. The sum-of-squares error (3.12) is then equal (up to a factor of 1/2) to the squared Euclidean distance between y and t. Thus the least-squares solution for w corresponds to that choice of y that lies in subspace S and that is closest to t. Intuitively, from Figure 3.2, we anticipate that this solution corresponds to the orthogonal projection of t onto the subspace S. This is indeed the case, as can easily be veriﬁed by noting that the solution for y is given by ΦwML, and then conﬁrming that this takes the form of an orthogonal projection.',\n",

Exercise 3.2 In practice, a direct solution of the normal equations can lead to numerical difﬁ- culties when ΦTΦ is close to singular. In particular, when two or more of the basis vectors ϕj are co-linear, or nearly so, the resulting parameter values can have large magnitudes. Such near degeneracies will not be uncommon when dealing with real data sets. The resulting numerical difﬁculties can be addressed using the technique of singular value decomposition, or SVD (Press et al.,1992; Bishop and Nabney, 2008). Note that the addition of a regularization term ensures that the matrix is non- singular, even in the presence of degeneracies.3.1.3 Sequential learning Batch techniques, such as the maximum likelihood solution (3.15), which in- volve processing the entire training set in one go, can be computationally costly for large data sets.

Sequential learning is also appropriate for real- time applications in which the data observations are arriving in a continuous stream, and predictions must be made before all of the data points are seen. We can obtain a sequential learning algorithm by applying the technique of stochastic gradient descent, also known as sequential gradient descent, as follows. If the error function comprises a sum over data points E = \\x05 n En, then after presen- tation of pattern n, the stochastic gradient descent algorithm updates the parameter vector w using w(τ+1) = w(τ) −η∇En (3.22) where τ denotes the iteration number, and η is a learning rate parameter. We shall discuss the choice of value for η shortly. The value of w is initialized to some starting vector w(0).

The value of η needs to be chosen with care to ensure that the algorithm converges (Bishop and Nabney, 2008).3.1.4 Regularized least squares In Section 1.1, we introduced the idea of adding a regularization term to an error function in order to control over-ﬁtting, so that the total error function to be minimized takes the form ED(w) + λEW (w) (3.24) where λ is the regularization coefﬁcient that controls the relative importance of the data-dependent error ED(w) and the regularization term EW (w).',\n",

In some applica- tions, we may wish to predict K > 1 target variables, which we denote collectively by the target vector t. This could be done by introducing a different set of basis func- tions for each component of t, leading to multiple, independent regression problems. However, a more interesting, and more common, approach is to use the same set of basis functions to model all of the components of the target vector so that y(x, w) = WTφ(x) (3.31) where y is a K-dimensional column vector, W is an M × K matrix of parameters, and φ(x) is an M-dimensional column vector with elements φj(x), with φ0(x) = 1 as before. Suppose we take the conditional distribution of the target vector to be an isotropic Gaussian of the form p(t|x, W, β) = N(t|WTφ(x), β−1I). (3.32) If we have a set of observations t1, . . . ,tN, we can combine these into a matrix T of size N × K such that the nth row is given by tT n. Similarly, we can combine the input vectors x1, . . . ,xN into a matrix X.

Thus the solution to the regression problem decouples between the different target variables, and we need only compute a single pseudo-inverse matrix Φ†, which is shared by all of the vectors wk. The extension to general Gaussian noise distributions having arbitrary covari- ance matrices is straightforward. Again, this leads to a decoupling into K inde- Exercise 3.6 pendent regression problems. This result is unsurprising because the parameters W deﬁne only the mean of the Gaussian noise distribution, and we know from Sec- tion 2.3.4 that the maximum likelihood solution for the mean of a multivariate Gaus- sian is independent of the covariance. From now on, we shall therefore consider a single target variable t for simplicity.3.2. The Bias-Variance Decomposition So far in our discussion of linear models for regression, we have assumed that the form and number of basis functions are both ﬁxed.

However, limiting the number of basis functions in order to avoid over-ﬁtting has the side effect of limiting the ﬂexibility of the model to capture interesting and important trends in the data. Although the introduction of regularization terms can control over-ﬁtting for models with many parameters, this raises the question of how to determine a suitable value for the regularization coefﬁcient λ. Seeking the solution that minimizes the regularized error function with respect to both the weight vector w and the regularization coefﬁcient λ is clearly not the right approach since this leads to the unregularized solution with λ = 0. As we have seen in earlier chapters, the phenomenon of over-ﬁtting is really an unfortunate property of maximum likelihood and does not arise when we marginalize over parameters in a Bayesian setting. In this chapter, we shall consider the Bayesian view of model complexity in some depth. Before doing so, however, it is instructive to consider a frequentist viewpoint of the model complexity issue, known as the bias- variance trade-off. Although we shall introduce this concept in the context of linear basis function models, where it is easy to illustrate the ideas using simple examples, the discussion has more general applicability. In Section 1.5.5, when we discussed decision theory for regression problems, we considered various loss functions each of which leads to a corresponding optimal prediction once we are given the conditional distribution p(t|x).

LINEAR MODELS FOR REGRESSION the squared loss function, for which the optimal prediction is given by the conditional expectation, which we denote by h(x) and which is given by h(x) = E[t|x] = \\x06 tp(t|x) dt. (3.36) At this point, it is worth distinguishing between the squared loss function arising from decision theory and the sum-of-squares error function that arose in the maxi- mum likelihood estimation of model parameters. We might use more sophisticated techniques than least squares, for example regularization or a fully Bayesian ap- proach, to determine the conditional distribution p(t|x). These can all be combined with the squared loss function for the purpose of making predictions. We showed in Section 1.5.5 that the expected squared loss can be written in the form E[L] = \\x06 {y(x) −h(x)}2 p(x) dx + \\x06 {h(x) −t}2p(x, t) dx dt. (3.37) Recall that the second term, which is independent of y(x), arises from the intrinsic noise on the data and represents the minimum achievable value of the expected loss. The ﬁrst term depends on our choice for the function y(x), and we will seek a so- lution for y(x) which makes this term a minimum. Because it is nonnegative, the smallest that we can hope to make this term is zero. If we had an unlimited supply of data (and unlimited computational resources), we could in principle ﬁnd the regres- sion function h(x) to any desired degree of accuracy, and this would represent the optimal choice for y(x). However, in practice we have a data set D containing only a ﬁnite number N of data points, and consequently we do not know the regression function h(x) exactly.',\n",

If we model the h(x) using a parametric function y(x, w) governed by a pa- rameter vector w, then from a Bayesian perspective the uncertainty in our model is expressed through a posterior distribution over w. A frequentist treatment, however, involves making a point estimate of w based on the data set D, and tries instead to interpret the uncertainty of this estimate through the following thought experi- ment. Suppose we had a large number of data sets each of size N and each drawn independently from the distribution p(t, x). For any given data set D, we can run our learning algorithm and obtain a prediction function y(x; D). Different data sets from the ensemble will give different functions and consequently different values of the squared loss. The performance of a particular learning algorithm is then assessed by taking the average over this ensemble of data sets. Consider the integrand of the ﬁrst term in (3.37), which for a particular data set D takes the form {y(x; D) −h(x)}2.

(3.40) We see that the expected squared difference between y(x; D) and the regression function h(x) can be expressed as the sum of two terms. The ﬁrst term, called the squared bias, represents the extent to which the average prediction over all data sets differs from the desired regression function. The second term, called the variance, measures the extent to which the solutions for individual data sets vary around their average, and hence this measures the extent to which the function y(x; D) is sensitive to the particular choice of data set. We shall provide some intuition to support these deﬁnitions shortly when we consider a simple example. So far, we have considered a single input value x. If we substitute this expansion back into (3.37), we obtain the following decomposition of the expected squared loss expected loss = (bias)2 + variance + noise (3.41) where (bias)2 = \\x06 {ED[y(x; D)] −h(x)}2p(x) dx (3.42) variance = \\x06 ED \\x08 {y(x; D) −ED[y(x; D)]}2\\t p(x) dx (3.43) noise = \\x06 {h(x) −t}2p(x, t) dx dt (3.44) and the bias and variance terms now refer to integrated quantities. Our goal is to minimize the expected loss, which we have decomposed into the sum of a (squared) bias, a variance, and a constant noise term. As we shall see, there is a trade-off between bias and variance, with very ﬂexible models having low bias and high variance, and relatively rigid models having high bias and low variance.

Although the bias-variance decomposition may provide some interesting in- sights into the model complexity issue from a frequentist perspective, it is of lim- ited practical value, because the bias-variance decomposition is based on averages with respect to ensembles of data sets, whereas in practice we have only the single observed data set. If we had a large number of independent training sets of a given size, we would be better off combining them into a single large training set, which of course would reduce the level of over-ﬁtting for a given model complexity. Given these limitations, we turn in the next section to a Bayesian treatment of linear basis function models, which not only provides powerful insights into the issues of over-ﬁtting but which also leads to practical techniques for addressing the question model complexity.3.3. Bayesian Linear Regression In our discussion of maximum likelihood for setting the parameters of a linear re- gression model, we have seen that the effective model complexity, governed by the number of basis functions, needs to be controlled according to the size of the data set. Adding a regularization term to the log likelihood function means the effective model complexity can then be controlled by the value of the regularization coefﬁ- cient, although the choice of the number and form of the basis functions is of course still important in determining the overall behaviour of the model. This leaves the issue of deciding the appropriate model complexity for the par- ticular problem, which cannot be decided simply by maximizing the likelihood func- tion, because this always leads to excessively complex models and over-ﬁtting. In- dependent hold-out data can be used to determine model complexity, as discussed in Section 1.3, but this can be both computationally expensive and wasteful of valu- able data.',\n",

For the mo- ment, we shall treat the noise precision parameter β as a known constant. First note that the likelihood function p(t|w) deﬁned by (3.10) is the exponential of a quadratic function of w.

Due to the choice of a conjugate Gaus- sian prior distribution, the posterior will also be Gaussian. We can evaluate this distribution by the usual procedure of completing the square in the exponential, and then ﬁnding the normalization coefﬁcient using the standard result for a normalized Gaussian. However, we have already done the necessary work in deriving the gen- Exercise 3.7 eral result (2.116), which allows us to write down the posterior distribution directly in the form p(w|t) = N(w|mN, SN) (3.49) where mN = SN S−1 0 m0 + βΦTt\\x0b (3.50) S−1 N = S−1 0 + βΦTΦ.

If we consider an inﬁnitely broad prior S0 = α−1I with α →0, the mean mN of the posterior distribution reduces to the maximum likelihood value wML given by (3.15). Similarly, if N = 0, then the posterior distribution reverts to the prior. Furthermore, if data points arrive sequentially, then the posterior distribution at any stage acts as the prior distribution for the subsequent data point, such that the new posterior distribution is again given by (3.49).

This requires that we evaluate the predictive distribution deﬁned by p(t|t, α, β) = \\x06 p(t|w, β)p(w|t, α, β) dw (3.57) in which t is the vector of target values from the training set, and we have omitted the corresponding input vectors from the right-hand side of the conditioning statements to simplify the notation. The conditional distribution p(t|x, w, β) of the target vari- able is given by (3.8), and the posterior weight distribution is given by (3.49). We see that (3.57) involves the convolution of two Gaussian distributions, and so making use of the result (2.115) from Section 8.1.4, we see that the predictive distribution takes the form Exercise 3.10 p(t|x, t, α, β) = N(t|mT Nφ(x), σ2 N(x)) (3.58) where the variance σ2 N(x) of the predictive distribution is given by σ2 N(x) = 1 β + φ(x)TSNφ(x).

The data set used to generate this kernel comprised 200 values of x equally spaced over the interval (−1, 1).3.3.3 Equivalent kernel The posterior mean solution (3.53) for the linear basis function model has an in- teresting interpretation that will set the stage for kernel methods, including Gaussian processes. If we substitute (3.53) into the expression (3.3), we see that the predictive Chapter 6 mean can be written in the form y(x, mN) = mT Nφ(x) = βφ(x)TSNΦTt = N \\x02 n=1 βφ(x)TSNφ(xn)tn (3.60) where SN is deﬁned by (3.51). Thus the mean of the predictive distribution at a point x is given by a linear combination of the training set target variables tn, so that we can write y(x, mN) = N \\x02 n=1 k(x, xn)tn (3.61) where the function k(x, x′) = βφ(x)TSNφ(x′) (3.62) is known as the smoother matrix or the equivalent kernel. Regression functions, such as this, which make predictions by taking linear combinations of the training set target values are known as linear smoothers. Note that the equivalent kernel depends on the input values xn from the data set because these appear in the deﬁnition of SN. The equivalent kernel is illustrated for the case of Gaussian basis functions in Figure 3.10 in which the kernel functions k(x, x′) have been plotted as a function of x′ for three different values of x. We see that they are localized around x, and so the mean of the predictive distribution at x, given by y(x, mN), is obtained by forming a weighted combination of the target values in which data points close to x are given higher weight than points further removed from x. Intuitively, it seems reasonable that we should weight local evidence more strongly than distant evidence. Note that this localization property holds not only for the localized Gaussian basis functions but also for the nonlocal polynomial and sigmoidal basis functions, as illustrated in Figure 3.11.',\n",

From the form of the equivalent kernel, we see that the predictive mean at nearby points will be highly correlated, whereas for more distant pairs of points the correlation will be smaller. The predictive distribution shown in Figure 3.8 allows us to visualize the point- wise uncertainty in the predictions, governed by (3.59). However, by drawing sam- ples from the posterior distribution over w, and plotting the corresponding model functions y(x, w) as in Figure 3.9, we are visualizing the joint uncertainty in the posterior distribution between the y values at two (or more) x values, as governed by the equivalent kernel. The formulation of linear regression in terms of a kernel function suggests an alternative approach to regression as follows. Instead of introducing a set of basis functions, which implicitly determines an equivalent kernel, we can instead deﬁne a localized kernel directly and use this to make predictions for new input vectors x, given the observed training set. This leads to a practical framework for regression (and classiﬁcation) called Gaussian processes, which will be discussed in detail in Section 6.4.

Bayesian Model Comparison In Chapter 1, we highlighted the problem of over-ﬁtting as well as the use of cross- validation as a technique for setting the values of regularization parameters or for choosing between alternative models. Here we consider the problem of model se- lection from a Bayesian perspective. In this section, our discussion will be very general, and then in Section 3.5 we shall see how these ideas can be applied to the determination of regularization parameters in linear regression. As we shall see, the over-ﬁtting associated with maximum likelihood can be avoided by marginalizing (summing or integrating) over the model parameters in- stead of making point estimates of their values. Models can then be compared di- rectly on the training data, without the need for a validation set.

For example, in Chapter 7 we shall introduce the relevance vector machine, which is a Bayesian model having one complexity parameter for every training data point. The Bayesian view of model comparison simply involves the use of probabilities to represent uncertainty in the choice of model, along with a consistent application of the sum and product rules of probability. Suppose we wish to compare a set of L models {Mi} where i = 1, . . . ,L. Here a model refers to a probability distribution over the observed data D.

Our uncertainty is expressed through a prior probability distribution p(Mi). Given a training set D, we then wish to evaluate the posterior distribution p(Mi|D) ∝p(Mi)p(D|Mi).

The model evidence is sometimes also called the marginal likelihood because it can be viewed as a likelihood function over the space of models, in which the parameters have been marginalized out. The ratio of model evidences p(D|Mi)/p(D|Mj) for two models is known as a Bayes factor (Kass and Raftery, 1995). Once we know the posterior distribution over models, the predictive distribution is given, from the sum and product rules, by p(t|x, D) = L \\x02 i=1 p(t|x, Mi, D)p(Mi|D). (3.67) This is an example of a mixture distribution in which the overall predictive distribu- tion is obtained by averaging the predictive distributions p(t|x, Mi, D) of individual models, weighted by the posterior probabilities p(Mi|D) of those models. For in- stance, if we have two models that are a-posteriori equally likely and one predicts a narrow distribution around t = a while the other predicts a narrow distribution around t = b, the overall predictive distribution will be a bimodal distribution with modes at t = a and t = b, not a single model at t = (a + b)/2. A simple approximation to model averaging is to use the single most probable model alone to make predictions. This is known as model selection. For a model governed by a set of parameters w, the model evidence is given, from the sum and product rules of probability, by p(D|Mi) = \\x06 p(D|w, Mi)p(w|Mi) dw. (3.68) From a sampling perspective, the marginal likelihood can be viewed as the proba- Chapter 11 bility of generating the data set D from a model whose parameters are sampled at random from the prior.',\n",

It is also interesting to note that the evidence is precisely the normalizing term that appears in the denominator in Bayes’ theorem when evaluating the posterior distribution over parameters because p(w|D, Mi) = p(D|w, Mi)p(w|Mi) p(D|Mi) . (3.69) We can obtain some insight into the model evidence by making a simple approx- imation to the integral over parameters. Consider ﬁrst the case of a model having a single parameter w. The posterior distribution over parameters is proportional to p(D|w)p(w), where we omit the dependence on the model Mi to keep the notation uncluttered. If we assume that the posterior distribution is sharply peaked around the most probable value wMAP, with width ∆wposterior, then we can approximate the in- tegral by the value of the integrand at its maximum times the width of the peak. If we further assume that the prior is ﬂat with width ∆wprior so that p(w) = 1/∆wprior, then we have p(D) = \\x06 p(D|w)p(w) dw ≃p(D|wMAP)∆wposterior ∆wprior (3.70)',\n",

(3.71) This approximation is illustrated in Figure 3.12. The ﬁrst term represents the ﬁt to the data given by the most probable parameter values, and for a ﬂat prior this would correspond to the log likelihood. The second term penalizes the model according to its complexity. Because ∆wposterior < ∆wprior this term is negative, and it increases in magnitude as the ratio ∆wposterior/∆wprior gets smaller. Thus, if parameters are ﬁnely tuned to the data in the posterior distribution, then the penalty term is large. For a model having a set of M parameters, we can make a similar approximation for each parameter in turn. Assuming that all parameters have the same ratio of ∆wposterior/∆wprior, we obtain ln p(D) ≃ln p(D|wMAP) + M ln \\x0f∆wposterior ∆wprior \\x10 .

As we increase the complexity of the model, the ﬁrst term will typically decrease, because a more complex model is better able to ﬁt the data, whereas the second term will increase due to the dependence on M. The optimal model complexity, as determined by the maximum evidence, will be given by a trade-off between these two competing terms. We shall later develop a more reﬁned version of this approximation, based on a Gaussian approximation to the posterior distribution. Section 4.4.1 We can gain further insight into Bayesian model comparison and understand how the marginal likelihood can favour models of intermediate complexity by con- sidering Figure 3.13. Here the horizontal axis is a one-dimensional representation of the space of possible data sets, so that each point on this axis corresponds to a speciﬁc data set. We now consider three models M1, M2 and M3 of successively increasing complexity. Imagine running these models generatively to produce exam- ple data sets, and then looking at the distribution of data sets that result. Any given',\n",

LINEAR MODELS FOR REGRESSION Figure 3.13 Schematic illustration of the distribution of data sets for three models of different com- plexity, in which M1 is the simplest and M3 is the most complex. Note that the dis- tributions are normalized. In this example, for the partic- ular observed data set D0, the model M2 with intermedi- ate complexity has the largest evidence.p(D) D D0 M1 M2 M3 model can generate a variety of different data sets since the parameters are governed by a prior probability distribution, and for any choice of the parameters there may be random noise on the target variables. To generate a particular data set from a spe- ciﬁc model, we ﬁrst choose the values of the parameters from their prior distribution p(w), and then for these parameter values we sample the data from p(D|w). A sim- ple model (for example, based on a ﬁrst order polynomial) has little variability and so will generate data sets that are fairly similar to each other. Its distribution p(D) is therefore conﬁned to a relatively small region of the horizontal axis. By contrast, a complex model (such as a ninth order polynomial) can generate a great variety of different data sets, and so its distribution p(D) is spread over a large region of the space of data sets. Because the distributions p(D|Mi) are normalized, we see that the particular data set D0 can have the highest value of the evidence for the model of intermediate complexity. Essentially, the simpler model cannot ﬁt the data well, whereas the more complex model spreads its predictive probability over too broad a range of data sets and so assigns relatively small probability to any one of them.',\n",

Implicit in the Bayesian model comparison framework is the assumption that the true distribution from which the data are generated is contained within the set of models under consideration. Provided this is so, we can show that Bayesian model comparison will on average favour the correct model. To see this, consider two models M1 and M2 in which the truth corresponds to M1. For a given ﬁnite data set, it is possible for the Bayes factor to be larger for the incorrect model. However, if we average the Bayes factor over the distribution of data sets, we obtain the expected Bayes factor in the form \\x06 p(D|M1) ln p(D|M1) p(D|M2) dD (3.73) where the average has been taken with respect to the true distribution of the data.

The Evidence Approximation 165 a Bayesian approach, like any approach to pattern recognition, needs to make as- sumptions about the form of the model, and if these are invalid then the results can be misleading. In particular, we see from Figure 3.12 that the model evidence can be sensitive to many aspects of the prior, such as the behaviour in the tails. Indeed, the evidence is not deﬁned if the prior is improper, as can be seen by noting that an improper prior has an arbitrary scaling factor (in other words, the normalization coefﬁcient is not deﬁned because the distribution cannot be normalized). If we con- sider a proper prior and then take a suitable limit in order to obtain an improper prior (for example, a Gaussian prior in which we take the limit of inﬁnite variance) then the evidence will go to zero, as can be seen from (3.70) and Figure 3.12. It may, however, be possible to consider the evidence ratio between two models ﬁrst and then take a limit to obtain a meaningful answer. In a practical application, therefore, it will be wise to keep aside an independent test set of data on which to evaluate the overall performance of the ﬁnal system.3.5. The Evidence Approximation In a fully Bayesian treatment of the linear basis function model, we would intro- duce prior distributions over the hyperparameters α and β and make predictions by marginalizing with respect to these hyperparameters as well as with respect to the parameters w. However, although we can integrate analytically over either w or over the hyperparameters, the complete marginalization over all of these variables is analytically intractable. Here we discuss an approximation in which we set the hyperparameters to speciﬁc values determined by maximizing the marginal likeli- hood function obtained by ﬁrst integrating over the parameters w. This framework is known in the statistics literature as empirical Bayes (Bernardo and Smith, 1994; Gelman et al.,2004), or type 2 maximum likelihood (Berger, 1985), or generalized maximum likelihood (Wahba, 1975), and in the machine learning literature is also called the evidence approximation (Gull, 1989; MacKay, 1992a).',\n",

If we introduce hyperpriors over α and β, the predictive distribution is obtained by marginalizing over w, α and β so that p(t|t) = \\x06\\x06\\x06 p(t|w, β)p(w|t, α, β)p(α, β|t) dw dα dβ (3.74) where p(t|w, β) is given by (3.8) and p(w|t, α, β) is given by (3.49) with mN and SN deﬁned by (3.53) and (3.54) respectively. Here we have omitted the dependence on the input variable x to keep the notation uncluttered. If the posterior distribution p(α, β|t) is sharply peaked around values \\x01α and \\x01β, then the predictive distribution is obtained simply by marginalizing over w in which α and β are ﬁxed to the values \\x01α and \\x01β, so that p(t|t) ≃p(t|t, \\x01α, \\x01β) = \\x06 p(t|w, \\x01β)p(w|t, \\x01α, \\x01β) dw.

(3.76) If the prior is relatively ﬂat, then in the evidence framework the values of \\x01α and \\x01β are obtained by maximizing the marginal likelihood function p(t|α, β). We shall proceed by evaluating the marginal likelihood for the linear basis function model and then ﬁnding its maxima. This will allow us to determine values for these hyperpa- rameters from the training data alone, without recourse to cross-validation. Recall that the ratio α/β is analogous to a regularization parameter. As an aside it is worth noting that, if we deﬁne conjugate (Gamma) prior distri- butions over α and β, then the marginalization over these hyperparameters in (3.74) can be performed analytically to give a Student’s t-distribution over w (see Sec- tion 2.3.7). Although the resulting integral over w is no longer analytically tractable, it might be thought that approximating this integral, for example using the Laplace approximation discussed (Section 4.4) which is based on a local Gaussian approxi- mation centred on the mode of the posterior distribution, might provide a practical alternative to the evidence framework (Buntine and Weigend, 1991). However, the integrand as a function of w typically has a strongly skewed mode so that the Laplace approximation fails to capture the bulk of the probability mass, leading to poorer re- sults than those obtained by maximizing the evidence (MacKay, 1999). Returning to the evidence framework, we note that there are two approaches that we can take to the maximization of the log evidence. We can evaluate the evidence function analytically and then set its derivative equal to zero to obtain re-estimation equations for α and β, which we shall do in Section 3.5.2.',\n",

We now complete the square over w Exercise 3.18 giving E(w) = E(mN) + 1 2(w −mN)TA(w −mN) (3.80) where we have introduced A = αI + βΦTΦ (3.81) together with E(mN) = β 2 ∥t −ΦmN∥2 + α 2 mT NmN.

However, in going to M = 2, the data ﬁt is improved only very marginally, due to the fact that the underlying sinusoidal function from which the data is generated is an odd function and so has no even terms in a polynomial expansion. Indeed, Figure 1.5 shows that the residual data error is reduced only slightly in going from M = 1 to M = 2. Because this richer model suffers a greater complexity penalty, the evidence actually falls in going from M = 1 to M = 2. When we go to M = 3 we obtain a signiﬁcant further improvement in data ﬁt, as seen in Figure 1.4, and so the evidence is increased again, giving the highest overall evidence for any of the polynomials. Further increases in the value of M produce only small improvements in the ﬁt to the data but suffer increasing complexity penalty, leading overall to a decrease in the evidence values. Looking again at Figure 1.5, we see that the generalization error is roughly constant between M = 3 and M = 8, and it would be difﬁcult to choose between these models on the basis of this plot alone.

Here we have implicitly transformed to a rotated set of axes in parameter space aligned with the eigenvec- tors ui deﬁned in (3.87). Contours of the likelihood function are then axis-aligned ellipses. The eigenvalues λi measure the curvature of the likelihood function, and so in Figure 3.15 the eigenvalue λ1 is small compared with λ2 (because a smaller curvature corresponds to a greater elongation of the contours of the likelihood func- tion). Because βΦTΦ is a positive deﬁnite matrix, it will have positive eigenvalues, and so the ratio λi/(λi + α) will lie between 0 and 1.

Limitations of Fixed Basis Functions Throughout this chapter, we have focussed on models comprising a linear combina- tion of ﬁxed, nonlinear basis functions. We have seen that the assumption of linearity in the parameters led to a range of useful properties including closed-form solutions to the least-squares problem, as well as a tractable Bayesian treatment.

It might appear, therefore, that such linear models constitute a general purpose framework for solving problems in pattern recognition. Unfortunately, there are some signiﬁcant shortcomings with linear models, which will cause us to turn in later chapters to more complex models such as support vector machines and neural networks. The difﬁculty stems from the assumption that the basis functions φj(x) are ﬁxed before the training data set is observed and is a manifestation of the curse of dimen- sionality discussed in Section 1.4. As a consequence, the number of basis functions needs to grow rapidly, often exponentially, with the dimensionality D of the input space. Fortunately, there are two properties of real data sets that we can exploit to help alleviate this problem. First of all, the data vectors {xn} typically lie close to a non- linear manifold whose intrinsic dimensionality is smaller than that of the input space as a result of strong correlations between the input variables. We will see an example of this when we consider images of handwritten digits in Chapter 12. If we are using localized basis functions, we can arrange that they are scattered in input space only in regions containing data. This approach is used in radial basis function networks and also in support vector and relevance vector machines.',\n",

Neural network models, which use adaptive basis functions having sigmoidal nonlinearities, can adapt the parameters so that the regions of input space over which the basis functions vary corresponds to the data manifold. The second property is that target variables may have signiﬁcant dependence on only a small number of possible directions within the data manifold. Neural networks can exploit this property by choosing the directions in input space to which the basis functions respond.

We now discuss an analogous class of models for solving classiﬁcation problems. The goal in classiﬁcation is to take an input vector x and to assign it to one of K discrete classes Ck where k = 1, . . . ,K. In the most common scenario, the classes are taken to be disjoint, so that each input is assigned to one and only one class. The input space is thereby divided into decision regions whose boundaries are called decision boundaries or decision surfaces. In this chapter, we consider linear models for classiﬁcation, by which we mean that the decision surfaces are linear functions of the input vector x and hence are deﬁned by (D −1)-dimensional hyperplanes within the D-dimensional input space. Data sets whose classes can be separated exactly by linear decision surfaces are said to be linearly separable. For regression problems, the target variable t was simply the vector of real num- bers whose values we wish to predict. In the case of classiﬁcation, there are various 179',\n",

For probabilistic models, the most convenient, in the case of two-class problems, is the binary representation in which there is a single target variable t ∈{0, 1} such that t = 1 represents class C1 and t = 0 represents class C2. We can interpret the value of t as the probability that the class is C1, with the values of probability taking only the extreme values of 0 and 1. For K > 2 classes, it is convenient to use a 1-of-K coding scheme in which t is a vector of length K such that if the class is Cj, then all elements tk of t are zero except element tj, which takes the value 1. For instance, if we have K = 5 classes, then a pattern from class 2 would be given the target vector t = (0, 1, 0, 0, 0)T. (4.1) Again, we can interpret the value of tk as the probability that the class is Ck. For nonprobabilistic models, alternative choices of target variable representation will sometimes prove convenient. In Chapter 1, we identiﬁed three distinct approaches to the classiﬁcation prob- lem. The simplest involves constructing a discriminant function that directly assigns each vector x to a speciﬁc class. A more powerful approach, however, models the conditional probability distribution p(Ck|x) in an inference stage, and then subse- quently uses this distribution to make optimal decisions. By separating inference and decision, we gain numerous beneﬁts, as discussed in Section 1.5.4.',\n",

       "  'sentence_chunk': 'By separating inference and decision, we gain numerous beneﬁts, as discussed in Section 1.5.4. There are two different approaches to determining the conditional probabilities p(Ck|x). One technique is to model them directly, for example by representing them as parametric models and then optimizing the parameters using a training set. Alternatively, we can adopt a generative approach in which we model the class-conditional densities given by p(x|Ck), together with the prior probabilities p(Ck) for the classes, and then we compute the required posterior probabilities using Bayes’ theorem p(Ck|x) = p(x|Ck)p(Ck) p(x) . (4.2) We shall discuss examples of all three approaches in this chapter. In the linear regression models considered in Chapter 3, the model prediction y(x, w) was given by a linear function of the parameters w. In the simplest case, the model is also linear in the input variables and therefore takes the form y(x) = wTx+w0, so that y is a real number. For classiﬁcation problems, however, we wish to predict discrete class labels, or more generally posterior probabilities that lie in the range (0, 1). To achieve this, we consider a generalization of this model in which we transform the linear function of w using a nonlinear function f( · ) so that y(x) = f wTx + w0 \\x0b . (4.3) In the machine learning literature f( · ) is known as an activation function, whereas its inverse is called a link function in the statistics literature. The decision surfaces correspond to y(x) = constant, so that wTx + w0 = constant and hence the deci- sion surfaces are linear functions of x, even if the function f(·) is nonlinear. For this reason, the class of models described by (4.3) are called generalized linear models',\n",

Note, however, that in contrast to the models used for regression, they are no longer linear in the parameters due to the presence of the nonlinear function f(·). This will lead to more complex analytical and computa- tional properties than for linear regression models. Nevertheless, these models are still relatively simple compared to the more general nonlinear models that will be studied in subsequent chapters. The algorithms discussed in this chapter will be equally applicable if we ﬁrst make a ﬁxed nonlinear transformation of the input variables using a vector of basis functions φ(x) as we did for regression models in Chapter 3. We begin by consider- ing classiﬁcation directly in the original input space x, while in Section 4.3 we shall ﬁnd it convenient to switch to a notation involving basis functions for consistency with later chapters.4.1. Discriminant Functions A discriminant is a function that takes an input vector x and assigns it to one of K classes, denoted Ck.

The negative of the bias is sometimes called a threshold. An input vector x is assigned to class C1 if y(x) ⩾0 and to class C2 otherwise. The cor- responding decision boundary is therefore deﬁned by the relation y(x) = 0, which corresponds to a (D −1)-dimensional hyperplane within the D-dimensional input space. Consider two points xA and xB both of which lie on the decision surface. Because y(xA) = y(xB) = 0, we have wT(xA −xB) = 0 and hence the vector w is orthogonal to every vector lying within the decision surface, and so w determines the orientation of the decision surface. Similarly, if x is a point on the decision surface, then y(x) = 0, and so the normal distance from the origin to the decision surface is given by wTx ∥w∥= −w0 ∥w∥. (4.5) We therefore see that the bias parameter w0 determines the location of the decision surface. These properties are illustrated for the case of D = 2 in Figure 4.1. Furthermore, we note that the value of y(x) gives a signed measure of the per- pendicular distance r of the point x from the decision surface. To see this, consider',\n",

The decision boundary between class Ck and class Cj is therefore given by yk(x) = yj(x) and hence corresponds to a (D −1)-dimensional hyperplane deﬁned by (wk −wj)Tx + (wk0 −wj0) = 0. (4.10) This has the same form as the decision boundary for the two-class case discussed in Section 4.1.1, and so analogous geometrical properties apply.

One justiﬁcation for using least squares in such a context is that it approximates the conditional expectation E[t|x] of the target values given the input vector. For the binary coding scheme, this conditional expectation is given by the vector of posterior class probabilities. Unfortunately, however, these probabilities are typically approximated rather poorly, indeed the approximations can have values outside the range (0, 1), due to the limited ﬂexibility of a linear model as we shall see shortly. Each class Ck is described by its own linear model so that yk(x) = wT k x + wk0 (4.13) where k = 1, . . . ,K.

We now determine the parameter matrix , W by minimizing a sum-of-squares error function, as we did for regression in Chapter 3.

However, even as a discriminant function (where we use it to make decisions directly and dispense with any probabilistic interpretation) it suf- fers from some severe problems. We have already seen that least-squares solutions Section 2.3.7 lack robustness to outliers, and this applies equally to the classiﬁcation application, as illustrated in Figure 4.4.

This shows a synthetic data set drawn from three classes in a two-dimensional input space (x1, x2), having the property that lin- ear decision boundaries can give excellent separation between the classes. Indeed, the technique of logistic regression, described later in this chapter, gives a satisfac- tory solution as seen in the right-hand plot.

Furthermore, we do not care about the magnitude of w, only its direction, and so we can drop the scalar factors (wTSBw) and (wTSWw). Multiplying both sides of (4.29) by S−1 W we then obtain w ∝S−1 W (m2 −m1).

The result (4.30) is known as Fisher’s linear discriminant, although strictly it is not a discriminant but rather a speciﬁc choice of direction for projection of the data down to one dimension. However, the projected data can subsequently be used to construct a discriminant, by choosing a threshold y0 so that we classify a new point as belonging to C1 if y(x) ⩾y0 and classify it as belonging to C2 otherwise. For example, we can model the class-conditional densities p(y|Ck) using Gaussian distributions and then use the techniques of Section 1.2.4 to ﬁnd the parameters of the Gaussian distributions by maximum likelihood.

This target value approximates the reciprocal of the prior probability for class C1. For class C2, we shall take the targets to be −N/N2, where N2 is the number of patterns in class C2.

This shows that the projection onto the (K −1)-dimensional subspace spanned by the eigenvectors of SB does not alter the value of J(w), and so we are therefore unable to ﬁnd more than (K −1) linear ‘features’ by this means (Fukunaga, 1990).4.1.7 The perceptron algorithm Another example of a linear discriminant model is the perceptron of Rosenblatt (1962), which occupies an important place in the history of pattern recognition al- gorithms.

In earlier discussions of two-class classiﬁcation problems, we have focussed on a target coding scheme in which t ∈{0, 1}, which is appropriate in the context of probabilistic models. For the perceptron, however, it is more convenient to use target values t = +1 for class C1 and t = −1 for class C2, which matches the choice of activation function. The algorithm used to determine the parameters w of the perceptron can most easily be motivated by error function minimization. A natural choice of error func- tion would be the total number of misclassiﬁed patterns. However, this does not lead to a simple learning algorithm because the error is a piecewise constant function of w, with discontinuities wherever a change in w causes the decision boundary to move across one of the data points. Methods based on changing w using the gradi- ent of the error function cannot then be applied, because the gradient is zero almost everywhere. We therefore consider an alternative error function known as the perceptron cri- terion. To derive this, we note that we are seeking a weight vector w such that patterns xn in class C1 will have wTφ(xn) > 0, whereas patterns xn in class C2 have wTφ(xn) < 0.',\n",

Initially, Rosenblatt simulated the perceptron on an IBM 704 computer at Cornell in 1957, but by the early 1960s he had built special-purpose hardware that provided a direct, par- allel implementation of perceptron learning. Many of his ideas were encapsulated in “Principles of Neuro- dynamics: Perceptrons and the Theory of Brain Mech- anisms” published in 1962. Rosenblatt’s work was criticized by Marvin Minksy, whose objections were published in the book “Perceptrons”, co-authored with Seymour Papert. This book was widely misinter- preted at the time as showing that neural networks were fatally ﬂawed and could only learn solutions for linearly separable problems. In fact, it only proved such limitations in the case of single-layer networks such as the perceptron and merely conjectured (in- correctly) that they applied to more general network models. Unfortunately, however, this book contributed to the substantial decline in research funding for neu- ral computing, a situation that was not reversed un- til the mid-1980s. Today, there are many hundreds, if not thousands, of applications of neural networks in widespread use, with examples in areas such as handwriting recognition and information retrieval be- ing used routinely by millions of people.',\n",

The contribution to the error associated with a particular misclassiﬁed pattern is a linear function of w in regions of w space where the pattern is misclassiﬁed and zero in regions where it is correctly classiﬁed. The total error function is therefore piecewise linear. We now apply the stochastic gradient descent algorithm to this error function. Section 3.1.3 The change in the weight vector w is then given by w(τ+1) = w(τ) −η∇EP(w) = w(τ) + ηφntn (4.55) where η is the learning rate parameter and τ is an integer that indexes the steps of the algorithm. Because the perceptron function y(x, w) is unchanged if we multiply w by a constant, we can set the learning rate parameter η equal to 1 without of generality. Note that, as the weight vector evolves during training, the set of patterns that are misclassiﬁed will change. The perceptron learning algorithm has a simple interpretation, as follows. We cycle through the training patterns in turn, and for each pattern xn we evaluate the perceptron function (4.52). If the pattern is correctly classiﬁed, then the weight vector remains unchanged, whereas if it is incorrectly classiﬁed, then for class C1 we add the vector φ(xn) onto the current estimate of weight vector w while for class C2 we subtract the vector φ(xn) from w.

The perceptron learning algorithm is illustrated in Figure 4.7. If we consider the effect of a single update in the perceptron learning algorithm, we see that the contribution to the error from a misclassiﬁed pattern will be reduced because from (4.55) we have −w(τ+1)Tφntn = −w(τ)Tφntn −(φntn)Tφntn < −w(τ)Tφntn (4.56) where we have set η = 1, and made use of ∥φntn∥2 > 0. Of course, this does not imply that the contribution to the error function from the other misclassiﬁed patterns will have been reduced. Furthermore, the change in weight vector may have caused some previously correctly classiﬁed patterns to become misclassiﬁed. Thus the perceptron learning rule is not guaranteed to reduce the total error function at each stage. However, the perceptron convergence theorem states that if there exists an ex- act solution (in other words, if the training data set is linearly separable), then the perceptron learning algorithm is guaranteed to ﬁnd an exact solution in a ﬁnite num- ber of steps. Proofs of this theorem can be found for example in Rosenblatt (1962), Block (1962), Nilsson (1965), Minsky and Papert (1969), Hertz et al. (1991), and Bishop (1995a). Note, however, that the number of steps required to achieve con- vergence could still be substantial, and in practice, until convergence is achieved, we will not be able to distinguish between a nonseparable problem and one that is simply slow to converge. Even when the data set is linearly separable, there may be many solutions, and which one is found will depend on the initialization of the parameters and on the or- der of presentation of the data points.

The perceptron also had a patch board, shown in the middle photograph, which allowed different conﬁgurations of input features to be tried. Often these were wired up at random to demonstrate the ability of the perceptron to learn without the need for precise wiring, in contrast to a modern digital computer. The photograph on the right shows one of the racks of adaptive weights. Each weight was implemented using a rotary variable resistor, also called a potentiometer, driven by an electric motor thereby allowing the value of the weight to be adjusted automatically by the learning algorithm. Aside from difﬁculties with the learning algorithm, the perceptron does not pro- vide probabilistic outputs, nor does it generalize readily to K > 2 classes. The most important limitation, however, arises from the fact that (in common with all of the models discussed in this chapter and the previous one) it is based on linear com- binations of ﬁxed basis functions. More detailed discussions of the limitations of perceptrons can be found in Minsky and Papert (1969) and Bishop (1995a).

At the same time that the perceptron was being developed, a closely related system called the adaline, which is short for ‘adaptive linear element’, was being explored by Widrow and co-workers.

However, it will have signiﬁcance provided a(x) takes a simple functional form. We shall shortly consider situations in which a(x) is a linear function of x, in which case the posterior probability is governed by a generalized linear model. For the case of K > 2 classes, we have p(Ck|x) = p(x|Ck)p(Ck) \\x05 j p(x|Cj)p(Cj) = exp(ak) \\x05 j exp(aj) (4.62) which is known as the normalized exponential and can be regarded as a multiclass generalization of the logistic sigmoid.

We now investigate the consequences of choosing speciﬁc forms for the class- conditional densities, looking ﬁrst at continuous input variables x and then dis- cussing brieﬂy the case of discrete inputs.4.2.1 Continuous inputs Let us assume that the class-conditional densities are Gaussian and then explore the resulting form for the posterior probabilities. To start with, we shall assume that all classes share the same covariance matrix. Thus the density for class Ck is given by p(x|Ck) = 1 (2π)D/2 1 |Σ|1/2 exp \\x0c −1 2(x −µk)TΣ−1(x −µk) \\r . (',\n",

The prior probabilities p(Ck) enter only through the bias parameter w0 so that changes in the priors have the effect of making parallel shifts of the decision boundary and more generally of the parallel contours of constant posterior probability. For the general case of K classes we have, from (4.62) and (4.63), ak(x) = wT k x + wk0 (4.68) where we have deﬁned wk = Σ−1µk (4.69) wk0 = −1 2µT k Σ−1µk + ln p(Ck).

The resulting decision boundaries, corresponding to the minimum misclassiﬁcation rate, will occur when two of the posterior probabilities (the two largest) are equal, and so will be deﬁned by linear functions of x, and so again we have a generalized linear model. If we relax the assumption of a shared covariance matrix and allow each class- conditional density p(x|Ck) to have its own covariance matrix Σk, then the earlier cancellations will no longer occur, and we will obtain quadratic functions of x, giv- ing rise to a quadratic discriminant.

Note that the approach of ﬁtting Exercise 4.10 Gaussian distributions to the classes is not robust to outliers, because the maximum likelihood estimation of a Gaussian is not robust. Section 2.3.7 4.2.3 Discrete features Let us now consider the case of discrete feature values xi. For simplicity, we begin by looking at binary feature values xi ∈{0, 1} and discuss the extension to more general discrete features shortly. If there are D inputs, then a general distribu- tion would correspond to a table of 2D numbers for each class, containing 2D −1 independent variables (due to the summation constraint). Because this grows expo- nentially with the number of features, we might seek a more restricted representa- tion. Here we will make the naive Bayes assumption in which the feature values are Section 8.2.2 treated as independent, conditioned on the class Ck. Thus we have class-conditional distributions of the form p(x|Ck) = D \\x0e i=1 µxi ki(1 −µki)1−xi (4.81) which contain D independent parameters for each class. Substituting into (4.63) then gives ak(x) = D \\x02 i=1 {xi ln µki + (1 −xi) ln(1 −µki)} + ln p(Ck) (4.82) which again are linear functions of the input values xi.',\n",

These are particular cases of a more general result obtained by assuming that the class-conditional densities p(x|Ck) are members of the exponential family of distributions. Using the form (2.194) for members of the exponential family, we see that the distribution of x can be written in the form p(x|λk) = h(x)g(λk) exp \\x1a λT k u(x)\\x1b . (4.83) We now restrict attention to the subclass of such distributions for which u(x) = x.

(4.84) Note that we are allowing each class to have its own parameter vector λk but we are assuming that the classes share the same scale parameter s. For the two-class problem, we substitute this expression for the class-conditional densities into (4.58) and we see that the posterior class probability is again given by a logistic sigmoid acting on a linear function a(x) which is given by a(x) = (λ1 −λ2)Tx + ln g(λ1) −ln g(λ2) + ln p(C1) −ln p(C2). (4.85) Similarly, for the K-class problem, we substitute the class-conditional density ex- pression into (4.63) to give ak(x) = λT k x + ln g(λk) + ln p(Ck) (4.86) and so again is a linear function of x. 4.3. Probabilistic Discriminative Models For the two-class classiﬁcation problem, we have seen that the posterior probability of class C1 can be written as a logistic sigmoid acting on a linear function of x, for a wide choice of class-conditional distributions p(x|Ck). Similarly, for the multiclass case, the posterior probability of class Ck is given by a softmax transformation of a linear function of x. For speciﬁc choices of the class-conditional densities p(x|Ck), we have used maximum likelihood to determine the parameters of the densities as well as the class priors p(Ck) and then used Bayes’ theorem to ﬁnd the posterior class probabilities. However, an alternative approach is to use the functional form of the generalized linear model explicitly and to determine its parameters directly by using maximum likelihood.

Bayes’ theorem, represents an example of generative modelling, because we could take such a model and generate synthetic data by drawing values of x from the marginal distribution p(x). In the direct approach, we are maximizing a likelihood function deﬁned through the conditional distribution p(Ck|x), which represents a form of discriminative training. One advantage of the discriminative approach is that there will typically be fewer adaptive parameters to be determined, as we shall see shortly. It may also lead to improved predictive performance, particularly when the class-conditional density assumptions give a poor approximation to the true dis- tributions.4.3.1 Fixed basis functions So far in this chapter, we have considered classiﬁcation models that work di- rectly with the original input vector x.

For the remainder of this chapter, we shall include a ﬁxed basis function transformation φ(x), as this will highlight some useful similarities to the regression models discussed in Chapter 3. For many problems of practical interest, there is signiﬁcant overlap between the class-conditional densities p(x|Ck). This corresponds to posterior probabilities p(Ck|x), which, for at least some values of x, are not 0 or 1. In such cases, the opti- mal solution is obtained by modelling the posterior probabilities accurately and then applying standard decision theory, as discussed in Chapter 1. Note that nonlinear transformations φ(x) cannot remove such class overlap. Indeed, they can increase the level of overlap, or create overlap where none existed in the original observation space. However, suitable choices of nonlinearity can make the process of modelling the posterior probabilities easier. Such ﬁxed basis function models have important limitations, and these will be Section 3.6 resolved in later chapters by allowing the basis functions themselves to adapt to the data. Notwithstanding these limitations, models with ﬁxed nonlinear basis functions play an important role in applications, and a discussion of such models will intro- duce many of the key concepts needed for an understanding of their more complex counterparts.',\n",

In our discussion of generative approaches in Section 4.2, we saw that under rather general assumptions, the posterior probability of class C1 can be written as a logistic sigmoid acting on a linear function of the feature vector φ so that p(C1|φ) = y(φ) = σ wTφ \\x0b (4.87) with p(C2|φ) = 1 −p(C1|φ). Here σ(·) is the logistic sigmoid function deﬁned by (4.59). In the terminology of statistics, this model is known as logistic regression, although it should be emphasized that this is a model for classiﬁcation rather than regression. For an M-dimensional feature space φ, this model has M adjustable parameters. By contrast, if we had ﬁtted Gaussian class conditional densities using maximum likelihood, we would have used 2M parameters for the means and M(M + 1)/2 parameters for the (shared) covariance matrix. Together with the class prior p(C1), this gives a total of M(M +5)/2+1 parameters, which grows quadratically with M, in contrast to the linear dependence on M of the number of parameters in logistic regression. For large values of M, there is a clear advantage in working with the logistic regression model directly. We now use maximum likelihood to determine the parameters of the logistic regression model. To do this, we shall make use of the derivative of the logistic sig- moid function, which can conveniently be expressed in terms of the sigmoid function itself Exercise 4.12 dσ da = σ(1 −σ). (',\n",

We see that the factor involving the derivative of the logistic sigmoid has cancelled, leading to a simpliﬁed form for the gradient of the log likelihood. In particular, the contribution to the gradient from data point n is given by the ‘error’ yn −tn between the target value and the prediction of the model, times the basis function vector φn. Furthermore, comparison with (3.13) shows that this takes precisely the same form as the gradient of the sum-of-squares error function for the linear regression model. Section 3.1.1 If desired, we could make use of the result (4.91) to give a sequential algorithm in which patterns are presented one at a time, in which each of the weight vectors is updated using (3.22) in which ∇En is the nth term in (4.91).

       "  'sentence_chunk': 'It is worth noting that maximum likelihood can exhibit severe over-ﬁtting for data sets that are linearly separable. This arises because the maximum likelihood so- lution occurs when the hyperplane corresponding to σ = 0.5, equivalent to wTφ = 0, separates the two classes and the magnitude of w goes to inﬁnity. In this case, the logistic sigmoid function becomes inﬁnitely steep in feature space, corresponding to a Heaviside step function, so that every training point from each class k is assigned a posterior probability p(Ck|x) = 1. Furthermore, there is typically a continuum Exercise 4.14 of such solutions because any separating hyperplane will give rise to the same pos- terior probabilities at the training data points, as will be seen later in Figure 10.13. Maximum likelihood provides no way to favour one such solution over another, and which solution is found in practice will depend on the choice of optimization algo- rithm and on the parameter initialization. Note that the problem will arise even if the number of data points is large compared with the number of parameters in the model, so long as the training data set is linearly separable.

Probabilistic Discriminative Models 207 4.3.3 Iterative reweighted least squares In the case of the linear regression models discussed in Chapter 3, the maxi- mum likelihood solution, on the assumption of a Gaussian noise model, leads to a closed-form solution. This was a consequence of the quadratic dependence of the log likelihood function on the parameter vector w. For logistic regression, there is no longer a closed-form solution, due to the nonlinearity of the logistic sigmoid function. However, the departure from a quadratic form is not substantial. To be precise, the error function is concave, as we shall see shortly, and hence has a unique minimum. Furthermore, the error function can be minimized by an efﬁcient iterative technique based on the Newton-Raphson iterative optimization scheme, which uses a local quadratic approximation to the log likelihood function. The Newton-Raphson update, for minimizing a function E(w), takes the form (Fletcher, 1987; Bishop and Nabney, 2008) w(new) = w(old) −H−1∇E(w). (4.92) where H is the Hessian matrix whose elements comprise the second derivatives of E(w) with respect to the components of w. Let us ﬁrst of all apply the Newton-Raphson method to the linear regression model (3.3) with the sum-of-squares error function (3.12).

(4.98) We see that the Hessian is no longer constant but depends on w through the weight- ing matrix R, corresponding to the fact that the error function is no longer quadratic. Using the property 0 < yn < 1, which follows from the form of the logistic sigmoid function, we see that uTHu > 0 for an arbitrary vector u, and so the Hessian matrix H is positive deﬁnite. It follows that the error function is a concave function of w and hence has a unique minimum. Exercise 4.15 The Newton-Raphson update formula for the logistic regression model then be- comes w(new) = w(old) −(ΦTRΦ)−1ΦT(y −t) = (ΦTRΦ)−1 \\x1a ΦTRΦw(old) −ΦT(y −t)\\x1b = (ΦTRΦ)−1ΦTRz (4.99) where z is an N-dimensional vector with elements z = Φw(old) −R−1(y −t).

Because the weighing matrix R is not constant but depends on the parameter vector w, we must apply the normal equations iteratively, each time using the new weight vector w to compute a revised weighing matrix R. For this reason, the algorithm is known as iterative reweighted least squares, or IRLS (Rubin, 1983). As in the weighted least-squares problem, the elements of the diagonal weighting matrix R can be interpreted as variances because the mean and variance of t in the logistic regression model are given by E[t] = σ(x) = y (4.101) var[t] = E[t2] −E[t]2 = σ(x) −σ(x)2 = y(1 −y) (4.102) where we have used the property t2 = t for t ∈{0, 1}.

Here we consider the use of maximum likelihood to determine the parameters {wk} of this model directly. To do this, we will require the derivatives of yk with respect to all of the activations aj. These are given by Exercise 4.17 ∂yk ∂aj = yk(Ikj −yj) (4.106) where Ikj are the elements of the identity matrix. Next we write down the likelihood function. This is most easily done using the 1-of-K coding scheme in which the target vector tn for a feature vector φn belonging to class Ck is a binary vector with all elements zero except for element k, which equals one.

Again, we could use this to formulate a sequential algorithm in which patterns are presented one at a time, in which each of the weight vectors is updated using (3.22). We have seen that the derivative of the log likelihood function for a linear regres- sion model with respect to the parameter vector w for a data point n took the form of the ‘error’ yn −tn times the feature vector φn. Similarly, for the combination of logistic sigmoid activation function and cross-entropy error function (4.90), and for the softmax activation function with the multiclass cross-entropy error function (4.108), we again obtain this same simple form.

However, not all choices of class-conditional density give rise to such a simple form for the posterior probabilities (for instance, if the class-conditional densities are modelled using Gaussian mixtures). This suggests that it might be worth exploring other types of discriminative probabilistic model.

One way to motivate an alternative choice for the link function is to consider a noisy threshold model, as follows. For each input φn, we evaluate an = wTφn and then we set the target value according to \\x0ctn = 1 if an ⩾θ tn = 0 otherwise. (4.112)',\n",

Note that the value of the blue curve at any point, such as that indicated by the vertical green line, corresponds to the slope of the red curve at the same point. Conversely, the value of the red curve at this point corresponds to the area under the blue curve indicated by the shaded green region.

One issue that can occur in practical applications is that of outliers, which can arise for instance through errors in measuring the input vector x or through misla- belling of the target value t. Because such points can lie a long way to the wrong side of the ideal decision boundary, they can seriously distort the classiﬁer. Note that the logistic and probit regression models behave differently in this respect because the tails of the logistic sigmoid decay asymptotically like exp(−x) for x →∞, whereas for the probit activation function they decay like exp(−x2), and so the probit model can be signiﬁcantly more sensitive to outliers. However, both the logistic and the probit models assume the data is correctly labelled. The effect of mislabelling is easily incorporated into a probabilistic model by introducing a probability ϵ that the target value t has been ﬂipped to the wrong value (Opper and Winther, 2000a), leading to a target value distribution for data point x of the form p(t|x) = (1 −ϵ)σ(x) + ϵ(1 −σ(x)) = ϵ + (1 −2ϵ)σ(x) (4.117) where σ(x) is the activation function with input vector x. Here ϵ may be set in advance, or it may be treated as a hyperparameter whose value is inferred from the data.4.3.6 Canonical link functions For the linear regression model with a Gaussian noise distribution, the error function, corresponding to the negative log likelihood, is given by (3.12). If we take the derivative with respect to the parameter vector w of the contribution to the error function from a data point n, this takes the form of the ‘error’ yn −tn times the feature vector φn, where yn = wTφn. Similarly, for the combination of the logistic sigmoid activation function and the cross-entropy error function (4.90), and for the softmax activation function with the multiclass cross-entropy error function (4.108), we again obtain this same simple form. We now show that this is a general result of assuming a conditional distribution for the target variable from the exponential family, along with a corresponding choice for the activation function known as the canonical link function. We again make use of the restricted form (4.84) of exponential family distribu- tions.',\n",

It is therefore necessary to introduce some form of approximation. Later in the book we shall consider a range of techniques based on analytical approximations Chapter 10 and numerical sampling. Chapter 11 Here we introduce a simple, but widely used, framework called the Laplace ap- proximation, that aims to ﬁnd a Gaussian approximation to a probability density deﬁned over a set of continuous variables. Consider ﬁrst the case of a single contin- uous variable z, and suppose the distribution p(z) is deﬁned by p(z) = 1 Z f(z) (4.125) where Z = \\x1c f(z) dz is the normalization coefﬁcient. We shall suppose that the value of Z is unknown. In the Laplace method the goal is to ﬁnd a Gaussian approx- imation q(z) which is centred on a mode of the distribution p(z). The ﬁrst step is to ﬁnd a mode of p(z), in other words a point z0 such that p′(z0) = 0, or equivalently df(z) dz \\x07\\x07\\x07\\x07 z=z0 = 0. (4.126) A Gaussian distribution has the property that its logarithm is a quadratic function of the variables.

At a stationary point z0 the gradient ∇f(z) will vanish. Expanding around this stationary point we have ln f(z) ≃ln f(z0) −1 2(z −z0)TA(z −z0) (4.131) where the M × M Hessian matrix A is deﬁned by A = −∇∇ln f(z)|z=z0 (4.132) and ∇is the gradient operator.

In order to apply the Laplace approximation we ﬁrst need to ﬁnd the mode z0, and then evaluate the Hessian matrix at that mode. In practice a mode will typi- cally be found by running some form of numerical optimization algorithm (Bishop',\n",

Many of the distributions encountered in practice will be mul- timodal and so there will be different Laplace approximations according to which mode is being considered. Note that the normalization constant Z of the true distri- bution does not need to be known in order to apply the Laplace method. As a result of the central limit theorem, the posterior distribution for a model is expected to become increasingly better approximated by a Gaussian as the number of observed data points is increased, and so we would expect the Laplace approximation to be most useful in situations where the number of data points is relatively large. One major weakness of the Laplace approximation is that, since it is based on a Gaussian distribution, it is only directly applicable to real variables. In other cases it may be possible to apply the Laplace approximation to a transformation of the variable. For instance if 0 ⩽τ < ∞then we can consider a Laplace approximation of ln τ. The most serious limitation of the Laplace framework, however, is that it is based purely on the aspects of the true distribution at a speciﬁc value of the variable, and so can fail to capture important global properties. In Chapter 10 we shall consider alternative approaches which adopt a more global perspective.4.4.1 Model comparison and BIC As well as approximating the distribution p(z) we can also obtain an approxi- mation to the normalization constant Z.

Consider a data set D and a set of models {Mi} having parameters {θi}. For each model we deﬁne a likelihood function p(D|θi, Mi). If we introduce a prior p(θi|Mi) over the parameters, then we are interested in computing the model evi- dence p(D|Mi) for the various models.

(4.138) The ﬁrst term on the right hand side of (4.137) represents the log likelihood evalu- ated using the optimized parameters, while the remaining three terms comprise the ‘Occam factor’ which penalizes model complexity.

This is known as the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) or the Schwarz criterion (Schwarz, 1978). Note that, compared to AIC given by (1.73), this penalizes model complexity more heavily. Complexity measures such as AIC and BIC have the virtue of being easy to evaluate, but can also give misleading results. In particular, the assumption that the Hessian matrix has full rank is often not valid since many of the parameters are not ‘well-determined’.

Evaluation of the predictive distribution is similarly intractable.

This requires evaluation of the second derivatives of the log posterior, which is equivalent to ﬁnding the Hessian matrix.

To obtain a Gaussian approximation to the posterior dis- tribution, we ﬁrst maximize the posterior distribution to give the MAP (maximum posterior) solution wMAP, which deﬁnes the mean of the Gaussian.

We saw that such models have useful analytical and computational properties but that their practical applicability was limited by the curse of dimensionality. In order to apply such models to large- scale problems, it is necessary to adapt the basis functions to the data. Support vector machines (SVMs), discussed in Chapter 7, address this by ﬁrst deﬁning basis functions that are centred on the training data points and then selecting a subset of these during training. One advantage of SVMs is that, although the training involves nonlinear optimization, the objective function is convex, and so the solution of the optimization problem is relatively straightforward. The number of basis functions in the resulting models is generally much smaller than the number of training points, although it is often still relatively large and typically increases with the size of the training set. The relevance vector machine, discussed in Section 7.2, also chooses a subset from a ﬁxed set of basis functions and typically results in much 225',\n",

An alternative approach is to ﬁx the number of basis functions in advance but allow them to be adaptive, in other words to use parametric forms for the basis func- tions in which the parameter values are adapted during training. The most successful model of this type in the context of pattern recognition is the feed-forward neural network, also known as the multilayer perceptron, discussed in this chapter. In fact, ‘multilayer perceptron’ is really a misnomer, because the model comprises multi- ple layers of logistic regression models (with continuous nonlinearities) rather than multiple perceptrons (with discontinuous nonlinearities). For many applications, the resulting model can be signiﬁcantly more compact, and hence faster to evaluate, than a support vector machine having the same generalization performance. The price to be paid for this compactness, as with the relevance vector machine, is that the like- lihood function, which forms the basis for network training, is no longer a convex function of the model parameters. In practice, however, it is often worth investing substantial computational resources during the training phase in order to obtain a compact model that is fast at processing new data. The term ‘neural network’ has its origins in attempts to ﬁnd mathematical rep- resentations of information processing in biological systems (McCulloch and Pitts, 1943; Widrow and Hoff, 1960; Rosenblatt, 1962; Rumelhart et al.,1986).',\n",

Indeed, it has been used very broadly to cover a wide range of different models, many of which have been the subject of exaggerated claims regarding their biological plau- sibility. From the perspective of practical applications of pattern recognition, how- ever, biological realism would impose entirely unnecessary constraints. Our focus in this chapter is therefore on neural networks as efﬁcient models for statistical pattern recognition. In particular, we shall restrict our attention to the speciﬁc class of neu- ral networks that have proven to be of greatest practical value, namely the multilayer perceptron. We begin by considering the functional form of the network model, including the speciﬁc parameterization of the basis functions, and we then discuss the prob- lem of determining the network parameters within a maximum likelihood frame- work, which involves the solution of a nonlinear optimization problem. This requires the evaluation of derivatives of the log likelihood function with respect to the net- work parameters, and we shall see how these can be obtained efﬁciently using the technique of error backpropagation. We shall also show how the backpropagation framework can be extended to allow other derivatives to be evaluated, such as the Jacobian and Hessian matrices. Next we discuss various approaches to regulariza- tion of neural network training and the relationships between them. We also consider some extensions to the neural network model, and in particular we describe a gen- eral framework for modelling conditional probability distributions known as mixture density networks.

There are, of course, many ways to construct parametric nonlinear basis functions. Neural networks use basis functions that follow the same form as (5.1), so that each basis function is itself a nonlinear function of a linear combination of the inputs, where the coefﬁcients in the linear combination are adaptive parameters.

(5.9) As can be seen from Figure 5.1, the neural network model comprises two stages of processing, each of which resembles the perceptron model of Section 4.1.7, and for this reason the neural network is also known as the multilayer perceptron, or MLP. A key difference compared to the perceptron, however, is that the neural net- work uses continuous sigmoidal nonlinearities in the hidden units, whereas the per- ceptron uses step-function nonlinearities. This means that the neural network func- tion is differentiable with respect to the network parameters, and this property will play a central role in network training. If the activation functions of all the hidden units in a network are taken to be linear, then for any such network we can always ﬁnd an equivalent network without hidden units. This follows from the fact that the composition of successive linear transformations is itself a linear transformation. However, if the number of hidden units is smaller than either the number of input or output units, then the transforma- tions that the network can generate are not the most general possible linear trans- formations from inputs to outputs because information is lost in the dimensionality reduction at the hidden units.',\n",

In Section 12.4.2, we show that networks of linear units give rise to principal component analysis. In general, however, there is little interest in multilayer networks of linear units. The network architecture shown in Figure 5.1 is the most commonly used one in practice. However, it is easily generalized, for instance by considering additional layers of processing each consisting of a weighted linear combination of the form (5.4) followed by an element-wise transformation using a nonlinear activation func- tion. Note that there is some confusion in the literature regarding the terminology for counting the number of layers in such networks. Thus the network in Figure 5.1 may be described as a 3-layer network (which counts the number of layers of units, and treats the inputs as units) or sometimes as a single-hidden-layer network (which counts the number of layers of hidden units). We recommend a terminology in which Figure 5.1 is called a two-layer network, because it is the number of layers of adap- tive weights that is important for determining the network properties. Another generalization of the network architecture is to include skip-layer con- nections, each of which is associated with a corresponding adaptive parameter. For',\n",

In principle, a network with sigmoidal hidden units can always mimic skip layer con- nections (for bounded input values) by using a sufﬁciently small ﬁrst-layer weight that, over its operating range, the hidden unit is effectively linear, and then com- pensating with a large weight value from the hidden unit to the output. In practice, however, it may be advantageous to include skip-layer connections explicitly. Furthermore, the network can be sparse, with not all possible connections within a layer being present. We shall see an example of a sparse network architecture when we consider convolutional neural networks in Section 5.5.6. Because there is a direct correspondence between a network diagram and its mathematical function, we can develop more general network mappings by con- sidering more complex network diagrams. However, these must be restricted to a feed-forward architecture, in other words to one having no closed directed cycles, to ensure that the outputs are deterministic functions of the inputs.

This transformation can be exactly compensated by changing the sign of all of the weights leading out of that hidden unit.

Network Training So far, we have viewed neural networks as a general class of parametric nonlinear functions from a vector x of input variables to a vector y of output variables. A simple approach to the problem of determining the network parameters is to make an analogy with the discussion of polynomial curve ﬁtting in Section 1.1, and therefore to minimize a sum-of-squares error function.

We have already seen many advantages of using probabilistic predictions in Section 1.5.4. Here it will also provide us with a clearer motivation both for the choice of output unit nonlinearity and the choice of error function. We start by discussing regression problems, and for the moment we consider a single target variable t that can take any real value. Following the discussions in Section 1.2.5 and 3.1, we assume that t has a Gaussian distribution with an x- dependent mean, which is given by the output of the neural network, so that p(t|x, w) = N t|y(x, w), β−1\\x0b (5.12) where β is the precision (inverse variance) of the Gaussian noise. Of course this is a somewhat restrictive assumption, and in Section 5.6 we shall see how to extend this approach to allow for more general conditional distributions. For the conditional distribution given by (5.12), it is sufﬁcient to take the output unit activation function to be the identity, because such a network can approximate any continuous function from x to y. Given a data set of N independent, identically distributed observations X = {x1, . . . ,xN}, along with corresponding target values t = {t1, . . . ,tN}, we can construct the corresponding likelihood function p(t|X, w, β) = N \\x0e n=1 p(tn|xn, w, β).',\n",

Note that in the neural networks literature, it is usual to con- sider the minimization of an error function rather than the maximization of the (log) likelihood, and so here we shall follow this convention.

Points at which the gradient vanishes are called stationary points, and may be further classiﬁed into minima, maxima, and saddle points. Our goal is to ﬁnd a vector w such that E(w) takes its smallest value. How- ever, the error function typically has a highly nonlinear dependence on the weights and bias parameters, and so there will be many points in weight space at which the gradient vanishes (or is numerically very small). Indeed, from the discussion in Sec- tion 5.1.1 we see that for any point w that is a local minimum, there will be other points in weight space that are equivalent minima. For instance, in a two-layer net- work of the kind shown in Figure 5.1, with M hidden units, each point in weight space is a member of a family of M!2M equivalent points. Section 5.1.1 Furthermore, there will typically be multiple inequivalent stationary points and in particular multiple inequivalent minima. A minimum that corresponds to the smallest value of the error function for any weight vector is said to be a global minimum. Any other minima corresponding to higher values of the error function are said to be local minima.

Thus, the computational effort needed to ﬁnd the minimum using such an approach would be O(W 3). Now compare this with an algorithm that makes use of the gradient information. Because each evaluation of ∇E brings W items of information, we might hope to ﬁnd the minimum of the function in O(W) gradient evaluations. As we shall see, by using error backpropagation, each such evaluation takes only O(W) steps and so the minimum can now be found in O(W 2) steps. For this reason, the use of gradient information forms the basis of practical algorithms for training neural networks.5.2.4 Gradient descent optimization The simplest approach to using gradient information is to choose the weight update in (5.27) to comprise a small step in the direction of the negative gradient, so that w(τ+1) = w(τ) −η∇E(w(τ)) (5.41) where the parameter η > 0 is known as the learning rate. After each such update, the gradient is re-evaluated for the new weight vector and the process repeated. Note that the error function is deﬁned with respect to a training set, and so each step requires that the entire training set be processed in order to evaluate ∇E. Techniques that use the whole data set at once are called batch methods. At each step the weight vector is moved in the direction of the greatest rate of decrease of the error function, and so this approach is known as gradient descent or steepest descent.',\n",

Although such an approach might intuitively seem reasonable, in fact it turns out to be a poor algorithm, for reasons discussed in Bishop and Nabney (2008). For batch optimization, there are more efﬁcient methods, such as conjugate gra- dients and quasi-Newton methods, which are much more robust and much faster than simple gradient descent (Gill et al.,1981; Fletcher, 1987; Nocedal and Wright, 1999). Unlike gradient descent, these algorithms have the property that the error function always decreases at each iteration unless the weight vector has arrived at a local or global minimum. In order to ﬁnd a sufﬁciently good minimum, it may be necessary to run a gradient-based algorithm multiple times, each time using a different randomly cho- sen starting point, and comparing the resulting performance on an independent vali- dation set. There is, however, an on-line version of gradient descent that has proved useful in practice for training neural networks on large data sets (Le Cun et al.,1989). Error functions based on maximum likelihood for a set of independent observations comprise a sum of terms, one for each data point E(w) = N \\x02 n=1 En(w).

There are of course intermediate scenarios in which the updates are based on batches of data points. One advantage of on-line methods compared to batch methods is that the former handle redundancy in the data much more efﬁciently. To see, this consider an ex- treme example in which we take a data set and double its size by duplicating every data point. Note that this simply multiplies the error function by a factor of 2 and so is equivalent to using the original error function. Batch methods will require double the computational effort to evaluate the batch error function gradient, whereas on- line methods will be unaffected. Another property of on-line gradient descent is the possibility of escaping from local minima, since a stationary point with respect to the error function for the whole data set will generally not be a stationary point for each data point individually. Nonlinear optimization algorithms, and their practical application to neural net- work training, are discussed in detail in Bishop and Nabney (2008).5.3.

It should be noted that the term backpropagation is used in the neural com- puting literature to mean a variety of different things. For instance, the multilayer perceptron architecture is sometimes called a backpropagation network. The term backpropagation is also used to describe the training of a multilayer perceptron us- ing gradient descent applied to a sum-of-squares error function. In order to clarify the terminology, it is useful to consider the nature of the training process more care- fully. Most training algorithms involve an iterative procedure for minimization of an error function, with adjustments to the weights being made in a sequence of steps. At each such step, we can distinguish between two distinct stages. In the ﬁrst stage, the derivatives of the error function with respect to the weights must be evaluated. As we shall see, the important contribution of the backpropagation technique is in pro- viding a computationally efﬁcient method for evaluating such derivatives.

The resulting formulae will then be illustrated using a simple layered network structure having a single layer of sigmoidal hidden units together with a sum-of-squares error. Many error functions of practical interest, for instance those deﬁned by maxi- mum likelihood for a set of i.i.d.data, comprise a sum of terms, one for each data point in the training set, so that E(w) = N \\x02 n=1 En(w). (5.44) Here we shall consider the problem of evaluating ∇En(w) for one such term in the error function. This may be used directly for sequential optimization, or the results can be accumulated over the training set in the case of batch methods. Consider ﬁrst a simple linear model in which the outputs yk are linear combina- tions of the input variables xi so that yk = \\x02 i wkixi (5.45) together with an error function that, for a particular input pattern n, takes the form En = 1 2 \\x02 k (ynk −tnk)2 (5.46) where ynk = yk(xn, w).

The sum in (5.48) is transformed by a nonlinear activation function h(·) to give the activation zj of unit j in the form zj = h(aj). (5.49) Note that one or more of the variables zi in the sum in (5.48) could be an input, and similarly, the unit j in (5.49) could be an output. For each pattern in the training set, we shall suppose that we have supplied the corresponding input vector to the network and calculated the activations of all of the hidden and output units in the network by successive application of (5.48) and (5.49). This process is often called forward propagation because it can be regarded as a forward ﬂow of information through the network. Now consider the evaluation of the derivative of En with respect to a weight wji. The outputs of the various units will depend on the particular input pattern n. However, in order to keep the notation uncluttered, we shall omit the subscript n from the network variables. First we note that En depends on the weight wji only via the summed input aj to unit j.

(5.57) In the above derivation we have implicitly assumed that each hidden or output unit in the network has the same activation function h(·). The derivation is easily general- ized, however, to allow different units to have individual activation functions, simply by keeping track of which form of h(·) goes with which unit.5.3.2 A simple example The above derivation of the backpropagation procedure allowed for general forms for the error function, the activation functions, and the network topology. In order to illustrate the application of this algorithm, we shall consider a particular example. This is chosen both for its simplicity and for its practical importance, be- cause many applications of neural networks reported in the literature make use of this type of network. Speciﬁcally, we shall consider a two-layer network of the form illustrated in Figure 5.1, together with a sum-of-squares error, in which the output units have linear activation functions, so that yk = ak, while the hidden units have logistic sigmoid activation functions given by h(a) ≡tanh(a) (5.58) where tanh(a) = ea −e−a ea + e−a .

(5.67) 5.3.3 Efﬁciency of backpropagation One of the most important aspects of backpropagation is its computational efﬁ- ciency. To understand this, let us examine how the number of computer operations required to evaluate the derivatives of the error function scales with the total number W of weights and biases in the network. A single evaluation of the error function (for a given input pattern) would require O(W) operations, for sufﬁciently large W. This follows from the fact that, except for a network with very sparse connections, the number of weights is typically much greater than the number of units, and so the bulk of the computational effort in forward propagation is concerned with evaluat- ing the sums in (5.48), with the evaluation of the activation functions representing a small overhead. Each term in the sum in (5.48) requires one multiplication and one addition, leading to an overall computational cost that is O(W). An alternative approach to backpropagation for computing the derivatives of the error function is to use ﬁnite differences. This can be done by perturbing each weight in turn, and approximating the derivatives by the expression ∂En ∂wji = En(wji + ϵ) −En(wji) ϵ + O(ϵ) (5.68) where ϵ ≪1. In a software simulation, the accuracy of the approximation to the derivatives can be improved by making ϵ smaller, until numerical roundoff problems arise.',\n",

However, numerical differentiation plays an important role in practice, because a comparison of the derivatives calculated by backpropagation with those obtained us- ing central differences provides a powerful check on the correctness of any software implementation of the backpropagation algorithm. When training networks in prac- tice, derivatives should be evaluated using backpropagation, because this gives the greatest accuracy and numerical efﬁciency. However, the results should be compared with numerical differentiation using (5.69) for some test cases in order to check the correctness of the implementation.5.3.4 The Jacobian matrix We have seen how the derivatives of an error function with respect to the weights can be obtained by the propagation of errors backwards through the network. The technique of backpropagation can also be applied to the calculation of other deriva- tives. Here we consider the evaluation of the Jacobian matrix, whose elements are given by the derivatives of the network outputs with respect to the inputs Jki ≡∂yk ∂xi (5.70) where each such derivative is evaluated with all other inputs held ﬁxed.

In general, the network mapping rep- resented by a trained neural network will be nonlinear, and so the elements of the Jacobian matrix will not be constants but will depend on the particular input vector used. Thus (5.72) is valid only for small perturbations of the inputs, and the Jacobian itself must be re-evaluated for each new input vector. The Jacobian matrix can be evaluated using a backpropagation procedure that is similar to the one derived earlier for evaluating the derivatives of an error function with respect to the weights. We start by writing the element Jki in the form Jki = ∂yk ∂xi = \\x02 j ∂yk ∂aj ∂aj ∂xi = \\x02 j wji ∂yk ∂aj (5.73) where we have made use of (5.48). The sum in (5.73) runs over all units j to which the input unit i sends connections (for example, over all units in the ﬁrst hidden layer in the layered topology considered earlier). We now write down a recursive backpropagation formula to determine the derivatives ∂yk/∂aj ∂yk ∂aj = \\x02 l ∂yk ∂al ∂al ∂aj = h′(aj) \\x02 l wlj ∂yk ∂al (5.74) where the sum runs over all units l to which unit j sends connections (corresponding to the ﬁrst index of wlj). Again, we have made use of (5.48) and (5.49). This backpropagation starts at the output units for which the required derivatives can be found directly from the functional form of the output-unit activation function. For instance, if we have individual sigmoidal activation functions at each output unit, then ∂yk ∂aj = δkjσ′(aj) (5.75) whereas for softmax outputs we have ∂yk ∂aj = δkjyk −ykyj. (',\n",

If there are W parameters (weights and biases) in the network, then the Hessian matrix has dimensions W × W and so the computational effort needed to evaluate the Hessian will scale like O(W 2) for each pattern in the data set. As we shall see, there are efﬁcient methods for evaluating the Hessian whose scaling is indeed O(W 2).5.4.1 Diagonal approximation Some of the applications for the Hessian matrix discussed above require the inverse of the Hessian, rather than the Hessian itself. For this reason, there has been some interest in using a diagonal approximation to the Hessian, in other words one that simply replaces the off-diagonal elements with zeros, because its inverse is trivial to evaluate. Again, we shall consider an error function that consists of a sum of terms, one for each pattern in the data set, so that E = \\x05 n En. The Hessian can then be obtained by considering one pattern at a time, and then summing the results over all patterns. From (5.48), the diagonal elements of the Hessian, for pattern n, can be written ∂2En ∂w2 ji = ∂2En ∂a2 j z2 i . (5.79) Using (5.48) and (5.49), the second derivatives on the right-hand side of (5.79) can be found recursively using the chain rule of differential calculus to give a backprop- agation equation of the form ∂2En ∂a2 j = h′(aj)2 \\x02 k \\x02 k′ wkjwk′j ∂2En ∂ak∂ak′ + h′′(aj) \\x02 k wkj ∂En ∂ak . (5.80) If we now neglect off-diagonal elements in the second-derivative terms, we obtain (Becker and Le Cun, 1989; Le Cun et al.,',\n",

(5.81) Note that the number of computational steps required to evaluate this approximation is O(W), where W is the total number of weight and bias parameters in the network, compared with O(W 2) for the full Hessian. Ricotti et al. (1988) also used the diagonal approximation to the Hessian, but they retained all terms in the evaluation of ∂2En/∂a2 j and so obtained exact expres- sions for the diagonal terms. Note that this no longer has O(W) scaling. The major problem with diagonal approximations, however, is that in practice the Hessian is typically found to be strongly nondiagonal, and so these approximations, which are driven mainly be computational convenience, must be treated with care.',\n",

The Hessian Matrix 251 5.4.2 Outer product approximation When neural networks are applied to regression problems, it is common to use a sum-of-squares error function of the form E = 1 2 N \\x02 n=1 (yn −tn)2 (5.82) where we have considered the case of a single output in order to keep the notation simple (the extension to several outputs is straightforward). We can then write the Exercise 5.16 Hessian matrix in the form H = ∇∇E = N \\x02 n=1 ∇yn∇yn + N \\x02 n=1 (yn −tn)∇∇yn. (5.83) If the network has been trained on the data set, and its outputs yn happen to be very close to the target values tn, then the second term in (5.83) will be small and can be neglected. More generally, however, it may be appropriate to neglect this term by the following argument. Recall from Section 1.5.5 that the optimal function that minimizes a sum-of-squares loss is the conditional average of the target data. The quantity (yn −tn) is then a random variable with zero mean. If we assume that its value is uncorrelated with the value of the second derivative term on the right-hand side of (5.83), then the whole term will average to zero in the summation over n. Exercise 5.17 By neglecting the second term in (5.83), we arrive at the Levenberg–Marquardt approximation or outer product approximation (because the Hessian matrix is built up from a sum of outer products of vectors), given by H ≃ N \\x02 n=1 bnbT n (5.84) where bn = ∇yn = ∇an because the activation function for the output units is simply the identity. Evaluation of the outer product approximation for the Hessian is straightforward as it only involves ﬁrst derivatives of the error function, which can be evaluated efﬁciently in O(W) steps using standard backpropagation. The elements of the matrix can then be found in O(W 2) steps by simple multiplication. It is important to emphasize that this approximation is only likely to be valid for a network that has been trained appropriately, and that for a general network mapping the second derivative terms on the right-hand side of (5.83) will typically not be negligible.',\n",

NEURAL NETWORKS 5.4.3 Inverse Hessian We can use the outer-product approximation to develop a computationally ef- ﬁcient procedure for approximating the inverse of the Hessian (Hassibi and Stork, 1993). First we write the outer-product approximation in matrix notation as HN = N \\x02 n=1 bnbT n (5.86) where bn ≡∇wan is the contribution to the gradient of the output unit activation arising from data point n. We now derive a sequential procedure for building up the Hessian by including data points one at a time. Suppose we have already obtained the inverse Hessian using the ﬁrst L data points. By separating off the contribution from data point L + 1, we obtain HL+1 = HL + bL+1bT L+1. (5.87) In order to evaluate the inverse of the Hessian, we now consider the matrix identity M + vvT\\x0b−1 = M−1 −(M−1v) vTM−1\\x0b 1 + vTM−1v (5.88) where I is the unit matrix, which is simply a special case of the Woodbury identity (C.7). If we now identify HL with M and bL+1 with v, we obtain H−1 L+1 = H−1 L −H−1 L bL+1bT L+1H−1 L 1 + bT L+1H−1 L bL+1 . (5.89) In this way, data points are sequentially absorbed until L+1 = N and the whole data set has been processed. This result therefore represents a procedure for evaluating the inverse of the Hessian using a single pass through the data set. The initial matrix H0 is chosen to be αI, where α is a small quantity, so that the algorithm actually ﬁnds the inverse of H + αI. The results are not particularly sensitive to the precise value of α. Extension of this algorithm to networks having more than one output is straightforward.',\n",

Because there are W 2 elements in the Hessian matrix, and because the evaluation of each element requires four forward propagations each needing O(W) operations (per pattern), we see that this approach will require O(W 3) operations to evaluate the complete Hessian. It therefore has poor scaling properties, although in practice it is very useful as a check on the soft- ware implementation of backpropagation methods. A more efﬁcient version of numerical differentiation can be found by applying central differences to the ﬁrst derivatives of the error function, which are themselves calculated using backpropagation. This gives ∂2E ∂wji∂wlk = 1 2ϵ \\x0c ∂E ∂wji (wlk + ϵ) −∂E ∂wji (wlk −ϵ) \\r + O(ϵ2).

The Hessian can also be evaluated exactly, for a net- work of arbitrary feed-forward topology, using extension of the technique of back- propagation used to evaluate ﬁrst derivatives, which shares many of its desirable features including computational efﬁciency (Bishop, 1991; Bishop, 1992). It can be applied to any differentiable error function that can be expressed as a function of the network outputs and to networks having arbitrary differentiable activation func- tions.

We have seen that the evaluation of the Hessian takes O(W 2) operations, and it also requires storage that is O(W 2). The vector vTH that we wish to calculate, however, has only W elements, so instead of computing the Hessian as an intermediate step, we can instead try to ﬁnd an efﬁcient approach to evaluating vTH directly in a way that requires only O(W) operations. To do this, we ﬁrst note that vTH = vT∇(∇E) (5.96) where ∇denotes the gradient operator in weight space. We can then write down the standard forward-propagation and backpropagation equations for the evaluation of ∇E and apply (5.96) to these equations to give a set of forward-propagation and backpropagation equations for the evaluation of vTH (Møller, 1993; Pearlmutter, 1994).',\n",

(5.111) The implementation of this algorithm involves the introduction of additional variables R{aj}, R{zj} and R{δj} for the hidden units and R{δk} and R{yk} for the output units. For each input pattern, the values of these quantities can be found using the above results, and the elements of vTH are then given by (5.110) and (5.111). An elegant aspect of this technique is that the equations for evaluating vTH mirror closely those for standard forward and backward propagation, and so the extension of existing software to compute this product is typically straightforward. If desired, the technique can be used to evaluate the full Hessian matrix by choosing the vector v to be given successively by a series of unit vectors of the form (0, 0, . . . ,1, . . . ,0) each of which picks out one column of the Hessian. This leads to a formalism that is analytically equivalent to the backpropagation procedure of Bishop (1992), as described in Section 5.4.5, though with some loss of efﬁciency due to redundant calculations.5.5.

Note that M controls the number of parameters (weights and biases) in the network, and so we might expect that in a maximum likelihood setting there will be an optimum value of M that gives the best generalization performance, corresponding to the optimum balance between under-ﬁtting and over-ﬁtting. Figure 5.9 shows an example of the effect of different values of M for the sinusoidal regression problem. The generalization error, however, is not a simple function of M due to the presence of local minima in the error function, as illustrated in Figure 5.10. Here we see the effect of choosing multiple random initializations for the weight vector for a range of values of M. The overall best validation set performance in this case occurred for a particular solution having M = 8. In practice, one approach to choosing M is in fact to plot a graph of the kind shown in Figure 5.10 and then to choose the speciﬁc solution having the smallest validation set error. There are, however, other ways to control the complexity of a neural network model in order to avoid over-ﬁtting. From our discussion of polynomial curve ﬁtting in Chapter 1, we see that an alternative approach is to choose a relatively large value for M and then to control complexity by the addition of a regularization term to the error function. The simplest regularizer is the quadratic, giving a regularized error',\n",

(5.112) This regularizer is also known as weight decay and has been discussed at length in Chapter 3. The effective model complexity is then determined by the choice of the regularization coefﬁcient λ. As we have seen previously, this regularizer can be interpreted as the negative logarithm of a zero-mean Gaussian prior distribution over the weight vector w. 5.5.1 Consistent Gaussian priors One of the limitations of simple weight decay in the form (5.112) is that is inconsistent with certain scaling properties of network mappings. To illustrate this, consider a multilayer perceptron network having two layers of weights and linear output units, which performs a mapping from a set of input variables {xi} to a set of output variables {yk}.

(5.114) Suppose we perform a linear transformation of the input data of the form xi →\\x04xi = axi + b. (5.115) Then we can arrange for the mapping performed by the network to be unchanged by making a corresponding linear transformation of the weights and biases from the inputs to the units in the hidden layer of the form Exercise 5.24 wji →\\x04wji = 1 awji (5.116) wj0 →\\x04wj0 = wj0 −b a \\x02 i wji. (5.117) Similarly, a linear transformation of the output variables of the network of the form yk →\\x04yk = cyk + d (5.118) can be achieved by making a transformation of the second-layer weights and biases using wkj →\\x04wkj = cwkj (5.119) wk0 →\\x04wk0 = cwk0 + d. (5.120) If we train one network using the original data and one network using data for which the input and/or target variables are transformed by one of the above linear transfor- mations, then consistency requires that we should obtain equivalent networks that differ only by the linear transformation of the weights as given. Any regularizer should be consistent with this property, otherwise it arbitrarily favours one solution over another, equivalent one. Clearly, simple weight decay (5.112), that treats all weights and biases on an equal footing, does not satisfy this property. We therefore look for a regularizer which is invariant under the linear trans- formations (5.116), (5.117), (5.119) and (5.120). These require that the regularizer should be invariant to re-scaling of the weights and to shifts of the biases. Such a regularizer is given by λ1 2 \\x02 w∈W1 w2 + λ2 2 \\x02 w∈W2 w2 (5.121) where W1 denotes the set of weights in the ﬁrst layer, W2 denotes the set of weights in the second layer, and biases are excluded from the summations.

The regularizer (5.121) corresponds to a prior of the form p(w|α1, α2) ∝exp \\x16 −α1 2 \\x02 w∈W1 w2 −α2 2 \\x02 w∈W2 w2 \\x17 . (5.122) Note that priors of this form are improper (they cannot be normalized) because the bias parameters are unconstrained. The use of improper priors can lead to difﬁculties in selecting regularization coefﬁcients and in model comparison within the Bayesian framework, because the corresponding evidence is zero. It is therefore common to include separate priors for the biases (which then break shift invariance) having their own hyperparameters. We can illustrate the effect of the resulting four hyperpa- rameters by drawing samples from the prior and plotting the corresponding network functions, as shown in Figure 5.11. More generally, we can consider priors in which the weights are divided into any number of groups Wk so that p(w) ∝exp \\x16 −1 2 \\x02 k αk∥w∥2 k \\x17 (5.123) where ∥w∥2 k = \\x02 j∈Wk w2 j.

The training of nonlinear network models corresponds to an iterative reduction of the error function deﬁned with re- spect to a set of training data.

The behaviour of the network in this case is sometimes explained qualitatively in terms of the effective number of degrees of freedom in the network, in which this number starts out small and then to grows during the training process, corresponding to a steady increase in the effective complexity of the model.

We see that the parameter αw 2 governs the vertical scale of functions (note the different vertical axis ranges on the top two diagrams), αw 1 governs the horizontal scale of variations in the function values, and αb 1 governs the horizontal range over which variations occur. The parameter αb 2, whose effect is not illustrated here, governs the range of vertical offsets of the functions.a minimum of the training error has been reached then represents a way of limiting the effective network complexity. In the case of a quadratic error function, we can verify this insight, and show that early stopping should exhibit similar behaviour to regularization using a sim- ple weight-decay term. This can be understood from Figure 5.13, in which the axes in weight space have been rotated to be parallel to the eigenvectors of the Hessian matrix. If, in the absence of weight decay, the weight vector starts at the origin and proceeds during training along a path that follows the local negative gradient vec- tor, then the weight vector will move initially parallel to the w2 axis through a point corresponding roughly to \\x04w and then move towards the minimum of the error func- tion wML. This follows from the shape of the error surface and the widely differing eigenvalues of the Hessian. Stopping at a point near \\x04w is therefore similar to weight decay.',\n",

The effective number of parameters in the network therefore grows during the course of training.5.5.3 Invariances In many applications of pattern recognition, it is known that predictions should be unchanged, or invariant, under one or more transformations of the input vari- ables. For example, in the classiﬁcation of objects in two-dimensional images, such as handwritten digits, a particular object should be assigned the same classiﬁcation irrespective of its position within the image (translation invariance) or of its size (scale invariance). Such transformations produce signiﬁcant changes in the raw data, expressed in terms of the intensities at each of the pixels in the image, and yet should give rise to the same output from the classiﬁcation system. Similarly in speech recognition, small levels of nonlinear warping along the time axis, which preserve temporal ordering, should not change the interpretation of the signal. If sufﬁciently large numbers of training patterns are available, then an adaptive model such as a neural network can learn the invariance, at least approximately. This involves including within the training set a sufﬁciently large number of examples of the effects of the various transformations.',\n",

We therefore seek alternative approaches for encouraging an adaptive model to exhibit the required invariances. These can broadly be divided into four categories: 1.

One way to achieve this is through the use of local receptive ﬁelds and shared weights, as discussed in the context of convolutional neural networks in Section 5.5.6. Approach 1 is often relatively easy to implement and can be used to encourage com- plex invariances such as those illustrated in Figure 5.14. For sequential training algorithms, this can be done by transforming each input pattern before it is presented to the model so that, if the patterns are being recycled, a different transformation (drawn from an appropriate distribution) is added each time. For batch methods, a similar effect can be achieved by replicating each data point a number of times and transforming each copy independently.

In Section 1.5.5 we saw that the function that minimizes the sum-of-squares error is given by the condi- tional average E[t|x] of the target values t. From (5.131) we see that the regularized error will equal the unregularized sum-of-squares plus terms which are O(ξ), and so the network function that minimizes the total error will have the form y(x) = E[t|x] + O(ξ). (5.133) Thus, to leading order in ξ, the ﬁrst term in the regularizer vanishes and we are left with Ω= 1 2 \\x06 τ T ∇y(x)\\x0b2 p(x) dx (5.134) which is equivalent to the tangent propagation regularizer (5.128). If we consider the special case in which the transformation of the inputs simply consists of the addition of random noise, so that x →x + ξ, then the regularizer takes the form Exercise 5.27 Ω= 1 2 \\x06 ∥∇y(x)∥2 p(x) dx (5.135) which is known as Tikhonov regularization (Tikhonov and Arsenin, 1977; Bishop, 1995b). Derivatives of this regularizer with respect to the network weights can be found using an extended backpropagation algorithm (Bishop, 1993). We see that, for small noise amplitudes, Tikhonov regularization is related to the addition of random noise to the inputs, which has been shown to improve generalization in appropriate circumstances (Sietsma and Dow, 1991).5.5.6 Convolutional networks Another approach to creating models that are invariant to certain transformation of the inputs is to build the invariance properties into the structure of a neural net- work.

Each input image comprises a set of pixel intensity values, and the desired output is a posterior proba- bility distribution over the ten digit classes. We know that the identity of the digit is invariant under translations and scaling as well as (small) rotations. Furthermore, the network must also exhibit invariance to more subtle transformations such as elastic deformations of the kind illustrated in Figure 5.14. One simple approach would be to treat the image as the input to a fully connected network, such as the kind shown in Figure 5.1. Given a sufﬁciently large training set, such a network could in principle yield a good solution to this problem and would learn the appropriate invariances by example. However, this approach ignores a key property of images, which is that nearby pixels are more strongly correlated than more distant pixels. Many of the modern approaches to computer vision exploit this property by extracting local features that depend only on small subregions of the image. Information from such features can then be merged in later stages of processing in order to detect higher-order features',\n",

Also, local features that are useful in one region of the image are likely to be useful in other regions of the image, for instance if the object of interest is translated. These notions are incorporated into convolutional neural networks through three mechanisms: (i) local receptive ﬁelds, (ii) weight sharing, and (iii) subsampling. The structure of a convolutional network is illustrated in Figure 5.17. In the convolutional layer the units are organized into planes, each of which is called a feature map. Units in a feature map each take inputs only from a small subregion of the image, and all of the units in a feature map are constrained to share the same weight values. For instance, a feature map might consist of 100 units arranged in a 10 × 10 grid, with each unit taking inputs from a 5×5 pixel patch of the image. The whole feature map therefore has 25 adjustable weight parameters plus one adjustable bias parameter.',\n",

Because we will typically need to detect multiple features in order to build an effective model, there will generally be multiple feature maps in the convolutional layer, each having its own set of weight and bias parameters. The outputs of the convolutional units form the inputs to the subsampling layer of the network. For each feature map in the convolutional layer, there is a plane of units in the subsampling layer and each unit takes inputs from a small receptive ﬁeld in the corresponding feature map of the convolutional layer. These units perform subsampling. For instance, each subsampling unit might take inputs from a 2 × 2 unit region in the corresponding feature map and would compute the average of those inputs, multiplied by an adaptive weight with the addition of an adaptive bias parameter, and then transformed using a sigmoidal nonlinear activation function. The receptive ﬁelds are chosen to be contiguous and nonoverlapping so that there are half the number of rows and columns in the subsampling layer compared with the convolutional layer. In this way, the response of a unit in the subsampling layer will be relatively insensitive to small shifts of the image in the corresponding regions of the input space. In a practical architecture, there may be several pairs of convolutional and sub- sampling layers.

The ﬁnal layer of the network would typically be a fully connected, fully adaptive layer, with a softmax output nonlinearity in the case of multiclass classiﬁcation. The whole network can be trained by error minimization using backpropagation to evaluate the gradient of the error function. This involves a slight modiﬁcation of the usual backpropagation algorithm to ensure that the shared-weight constraints are satisﬁed. Due to the use of local receptive ﬁelds, the number of weights in Exercise 5.28 the network is smaller than if the network were fully connected. Furthermore, the number of independent parameters to be learned from the data is much smaller still, due to the substantial numbers of constraints on the weights.5.5.7 Soft weight sharing One way to reduce the effective complexity of a network with a large number of weights is to constrain weights within certain groups to be equal. This is the technique of weight sharing that was discussed in Section 5.5.6 as a way of building translation invariance into networks used for image interpretation. It is only appli- cable, however, to particular problems in which the form of the constraints can be speciﬁed in advance.

We can encour- age the weight values to form several groups, rather than just one group, by consid- ering instead a probability distribution that is a mixture of Gaussians. The centres Section 2.3.9 and variances of the Gaussian components, as well as the mixing coefﬁcients, will be considered as adjustable parameters to be determined as part of the learning process. Thus, we have a probability density of the form p(w) = \\x0e i p(wi) (5.136) where p(wi) = M \\x02 j=1 πjN(wi|µj, σ2 j) (5.137) and πj are the mixing coefﬁcients.

This error is minimized both with respect to the weights wi and with respect to the parameters {πj, µj, σj} of the mixture model. If the weights were constant, then the parameters of the mixture model could be determined by using the EM algorithm discussed in Chapter 9. However, the dis- tribution of weights is itself evolving during the learning process, and so to avoid nu- merical instability, a joint optimization is performed simultaneously over the weights and the mixture-model parameters. This can be done using a standard optimization algorithm such as conjugate gradients or quasi-Newton methods.',\n",

Regularization in Neural Networks 271 The effect of the regularization term is therefore to pull each weight towards the centre of the jth Gaussian, with a force proportional to the posterior probability of that Gaussian for the given weight. This is precisely the kind of effect that we are seeking. Derivatives of the error with respect to the centres of the Gaussians are also easily computed to give Exercise 5.30 ∂\\x04E ∂µj = λ \\x02 i γj(wi)(µi −wj) σ2 j (5.142) which has a simple intuitive interpretation, because it pushes µj towards an aver- age of the weight values, weighted by the posterior probabilities that the respective weight parameters were generated by component j.

Note that in a practical implementation, new variables ηj deﬁned by σ2 j = exp(ηj) (5.144) are introduced, and the minimization is performed with respect to the ηj. This en- sures that the parameters σj remain positive. It also has the effect of discouraging pathological solutions in which one or more of the σj goes to zero, corresponding to a Gaussian component collapsing onto one of the weight parameter values. Such solutions are discussed in more detail in the context of Gaussian mixture models in Section 9.2.1. For the derivatives with respect to the mixing coefﬁcients πj, we need to take account of the constraints \\x02 j πj = 1, 0 ⩽πi ⩽1 (5.145) which follow from the interpretation of the πj as prior probabilities.

However, practical machine learning problems can often have signiﬁcantly non-Gaussian distributions. These can arise, for example, with inverse problems in which the distribution can be multimodal, in which case the Gaussian assumption can lead to very poor predic- tions.

We therefore need to solve the inverse problem, which has two solutions as seen in Figure 5.18. Forward problems often corresponds to causality in a physical system and gen- erally have a unique solution. For instance, a speciﬁc pattern of symptoms in the human body may be caused by the presence of a particular disease. In pattern recog- nition, however, we typically have to solve an inverse problem, such as trying to predict the presence of a disease given a set of symptoms. If the forward problem involves a many-to-one mapping, then the inverse problem will have multiple solu- tions. For instance, several different diseases may result in the same symptoms. In the robotics example, the kinematics is deﬁned by geometrical equations, and the multimodality is readily apparent.

The structure of this mixture density network is illustrated in Figure 5.20. The mixture density network is closely related to the mixture of experts discussed in Section 14.5.3. The principle difference is that in the mixture density network the same function is used to predict the parameters of all of the component densities as well as the mixing co- efﬁcients, and so the nonlinear hidden units are shared amongst the input-dependent functions. The neural network in Figure 5.20 can, for example, be a two-layer network having sigmoidal (‘tanh’) hidden units. If there are L components in the mixture model (5.148), and if t has K components, then the network will have L output unit activations denoted by aπ k that determine the mixing coefﬁcients πk(x), K outputs denoted by aσ k that determine the kernel widths σk(x), and L × K outputs denoted by aµ kj that determine the components µkj(x) of the kernel centres µk(x).

Bayesian Neural Networks So far, our discussion of neural networks has focussed on the use of maximum like- lihood to determine the network parameters (weights and biases). Regularized max- imum likelihood can be interpreted as a MAP (maximum posterior) approach in which the regularizer can be viewed as the logarithm of a prior parameter distribu- tion. However, in a Bayesian treatment we need to marginalize over the distribution of parameters in order to make predictions. In Section 3.3, we developed a Bayesian solution for a simple linear regression model under the assumption of Gaussian noise. We saw that the posterior distribu- tion, which is Gaussian, could be evaluated exactly and that the predictive distribu- tion could also be found in closed form. In the case of a multilayered network, the highly nonlinear dependence of the network function on the parameter values means that an exact Bayesian treatment can no longer be found. In fact, the log of the pos- terior distribution will be nonconvex, corresponding to the multiple local minima in the error function. The technique of variational inference, to be discussed in Chapter 10, has been applied to Bayesian neural networks using a factorized Gaussian approximation',\n",

The most complete treatment, however, has been based on the Laplace approximation (MacKay, 1992c; MacKay, 1992b) and forms the basis for the discussion given here. We will approximate the posterior distribution by a Gaussian, centred at a mode of the true posterior. Furthermore, we shall assume that the covariance of this Gaus- sian is small so that the network function is approximately linear with respect to the parameters over the region of parameter space for which the posterior probability is signiﬁcantly nonzero. With these two approximations, we will obtain models that are analogous to the linear regression and classiﬁcation models discussed in earlier chapters and so we can exploit the results obtained there. We can then make use of the evidence framework to provide point estimates for the hyperparameters and to compare alternative models (for example, networks having different numbers of hid- den units). To start with, we shall discuss the regression case and then later consider the modiﬁcations needed for solving classiﬁcation tasks.5.7.1 Posterior parameter distribution Consider the problem of predicting a single continuous target variable t from a vector x of inputs (the extension to multiple targets is straightforward). We shall suppose that the conditional distribution p(t|x) is Gaussian, with an x-dependent mean given by the output of a neural network model y(x, w), and with precision (inverse variance) β p(t|x, w, β) = N(t|y(x, w), β−1).

We can ﬁnd a Gaussian approximation to the posterior distribution by using the Laplace approximation. To do this, we must ﬁrst ﬁnd a (local) maximum of the posterior, and this must be done using iterative numerical optimization.

Assuming for the moment that α and β are ﬁxed, we can ﬁnd a maximum of the posterior, which we denote wMAP, by standard nonlinear optimization algorithms such as conjugate gradients, using error backpropagation to evaluate the required derivatives. Having found a mode wMAP, we can then build a local Gaussian approximation by evaluating the matrix of second derivatives of the negative log posterior distribu- tion. From (5.165), this is given by A = −∇∇ln p(w|D, α, β) = αI + βH (5.166) where H is the Hessian matrix comprising the second derivatives of the sum-of- squares error function with respect to the components of w. Algorithms for comput- ing and approximating the Hessian were discussed in Section 5.4. The corresponding Gaussian approximation to the posterior is then given from (4.134) by q(w|D) = N(w|wMAP, A−1). (5.167) Similarly, the predictive distribution is obtained by marginalizing with respect to this posterior distribution p(t|x, D) = \\x06 p(t|x, w)q(w|D) dw. (5.168) However, even with the Gaussian approximation to the posterior, this integration is still analytically intractable due to the nonlinearity of the network function y(x, w) as a function of w. To make progress, we now assume that the posterior distribution has small variance compared with the characteristic scales of w over which y(x, w) is varying. This allows us to make a Taylor series expansion of the network function around wMAP and retain only the linear terms y(x, w) ≃y(x, wMAP) + gT(w −wMAP) (5.169) where we have deﬁned g = ∇wy(x, w)|w=wMAP .

The variance has two terms, the ﬁrst of which arises from the intrinsic noise on the target variable, whereas the second is an x-dependent term that expresses the uncertainty in the interpolant due to the uncertainty in the model parameters w. This should be compared with the corresponding predictive distribution for the linear regression model, given by (3.58) and (3.59).5.7.2 Hyperparameter optimization So far, we have assumed that the hyperparameters α and β are ﬁxed and known. We can make use of the evidence framework, discussed in Section 3.5, together with the Gaussian approximation to the posterior obtained using the Laplace approxima- tion, to obtain a practical procedure for choosing the values of such hyperparameters. The marginal likelihood, or evidence, for the hyperparameters is obtained by integrating over the network weights p(D|α, β) = \\x06 p(D|w, β)p(w|α) dw. (5.174) This is easily evaluated by making use of the Laplace approximation result (4.135).

As a consequence, the solution for wMAP found by maximiz- ing the log posterior will depend on the initialization of w. Solutions that differ only as a consequence of the interchange and sign reversal symmetries in the hidden units Section 5.1.1 are identical so far as predictions are concerned, and it is irrelevant which of the equivalent solutions is found.

A more careful evaluation is obtained by marginalizing over α and β, again by making a Gaussian approxima- tion (MacKay, 1992c; Bishop, 1995a). In either case, it is necessary to evaluate the determinant |A| of the Hessian matrix. This can be problematic in practice because the determinant, unlike the trace, is sensitive to the small eigenvalues that are often difﬁcult to determine accurately. The Laplace approximation is based on a local quadratic expansion around a mode of the posterior distribution over weights.

We shall build extensively on the analogous results for linear Exercise 5.40 classiﬁcation models discussed in Section 4.5, and so we encourage the reader to familiarize themselves with that material before studying this section. The log likelihood function for this model is given by ln p(D|w) = \\x02 n = 1N {tn ln yn + (1 −tn) ln(1 −yn)} (5.181) where tn ∈{0, 1} are the target values, and yn ≡y(xn, w).

The ﬁrst stage in applying the Laplace framework to this model is to initialize the hyperparameter α, and then to determine the parameter vector w by maximizing the log posterior distribution. This is equivalent to minimizing the regularized error function E(w) = −ln p(D|w) + α 2 wTw (5.182) and can be achieved using error backpropagation combined with standard optimiza- tion algorithms, as discussed in Section 5.3.

Instead, we make a linear approximation for the output unit activation in the form a(x, w) ≃aMAP(x) + bT(w −wMAP) (5.186) where aMAP(x) = a(x, wMAP), and the vector b ≡∇a(x, wMAP) can be found by backpropagation. Because we now have a Gaussian approximation for the posterior distribution over w, and a model for a that is a linear function of w, we can now appeal to the results of Section 4.5.2. The distribution of output unit activation values, induced by the distribution over network weights, is given by p(a|x, D) = \\x06 δ a −aMAP(x) −bT(x)(w −wMAP) \\x0b q(w|D) dw (5.187) where q(w|D) is the Gaussian approximation to the posterior distribution given by (5.167). From Section 4.5.2, we see that this distribution is Gaussian with mean aMAP ≡a(x, wMAP), and variance σ2 a(x) = bT(x)A−1b(x). (',\n",

The weight parameters were found using scaled conjugate gradients, and the hyperparameter α was optimized using the evidence framework. On the left is the result of using the simple approximation (5.185) based on a point estimate wMAP of the parameters, in which the green curve shows the y = 0.5 decision boundary, and the other contours correspond to output probabilities of y = 0.1, 0.3, 0.7, and 0.9. On the right is the corresponding result obtained using (5.190). Note that the effect of marginalization is to spread out the contours and to make the predictions less conﬁdent, so that at each input point x, the posterior probabilities are shifted towards 0.5, while the y = 0.5 contour itself is unaffected. The convolution of a Gaussian with a logistic sigmoid is intractable. We therefore apply the approximation (4.153) to (5.189) giving p(t = 1|x, D) = σ κ(σ2 a)bTwMAP \\x0b (5.190) where κ(·) is deﬁned by (4.154). Recall that both σ2 a and b are functions of x.

During the learning phase, a set of training data is used either to obtain a point estimate of the parameter vector or to determine a posterior distribution over this vector. The training data is then discarded, and predictions for new inputs are based purely on the learned parameter vector w. This approach is also used in nonlinear parametric models such as neural networks. Chapter 5 However, there is a class of pattern recognition techniques, in which the training data points, or a subset of them, are kept and used also during the prediction phase. For instance, the Parzen probability density model comprised a linear combination Section 2.5.1 of ‘kernel’ functions each one centred on one of the training data points.

These are examples of memory-based methods that involve storing the entire training set in order to make predictions for future data points. They typically require a metric to be deﬁned that measures the similarity of any two vectors in input space, and are generally fast to ‘train’ but slow at making predictions for test data points. Many linear parametric models can be re-cast into an equivalent ‘dual represen- tation’ in which the predictions are also based on linear combinations of a kernel function evaluated at the training data points. As we shall see, for models which are based on a ﬁxed nonlinear feature space mapping φ(x), the kernel function is given by the relation k(x, x′) = φ(x)Tφ(x′). (6.1) From this deﬁnition, we see that the kernel is a symmetric function of its arguments so that k(x, x′) = k(x′, x). The kernel concept was introduced into the ﬁeld of pat- tern recognition by Aizerman et al. (1964) in the context of the method of potential functions, so-called because of an analogy with electrostatics. Although neglected for many years, it was re-introduced into machine learning in the context of large- margin classiﬁers by Boser et al.

Since then, there has been considerable interest in this topic, both Chapter 7 in terms of theory and applications. One of the most signiﬁcant developments has been the extension of kernels to handle symbolic objects, thereby greatly expanding the range of problems that can be addressed. The simplest example of a kernel function is obtained by considering the identity mapping for the feature space in (6.1) so that φ(x) = x, in which case k(x, x′) = xTx′. We shall refer to this as the linear kernel. The concept of a kernel formulated as an inner product in a feature space allows us to build interesting extensions of many well-known algorithms by making use of the kernel trick, also known as kernel substitution. The general idea is that, if we have an algorithm formulated in such a way that the input vector x enters only in the form of scalar products, then we can replace that scalar product with some other choice of kernel. For instance, the technique of kernel substitution can be applied to principal component analysis in order to develop a nonlinear variant of PCA (Sch¨olkopf et al.,Section 12.3 1998). Other examples of kernel substitution include nearest-neighbour classiﬁers and the kernel Fisher discriminant (Mika et al.,1999; Roth and Steinhage, 2000; Baudat and Anouar, 2000).

If we set the gradient of J(w) with respect to w equal to zero, we see that the solution for w takes the form of a linear combination of the vectors φ(xn), with coefﬁcients that are functions of w, of the form w = −1 λ N \\x02 n=1 \\x1a wTφ(xn) −tn \\x1b φ(xn) = N \\x02 n=1 anφ(xn) = ΦTa (6.3) where Φ is the design matrix, whose nth row is given by φ(xn)T. Here the vector a = (a1, . . . ,aN)T, and we have deﬁned an = −1 λ \\x1a wTφ(xn) −tn \\x1b . (6.4) Instead of working with the parameter vector w, we can now reformulate the least- squares algorithm in terms of the parameter vector a, giving rise to a dual represen- tation. If we substitute w = ΦTa into J(w), we obtain J(a) = 1 2aTΦΦTΦΦTa −aTΦΦTt + 1 2tTt + λ 2 aTΦΦTa (6.5) where t = (t1, . . . ,tN)T. We now deﬁne the Gram matrix K = ΦΦT, which is an N × N symmetric matrix with elements Knm = φ(xn)Tφ(xm) = k(xn, xm) (6.6) where we have introduced the kernel function k(x, x′) deﬁned by (6.1). In terms of the Gram matrix, the sum-of-squares error function can be written as J(a) = 1 2aTKKa −aTKt + 1 2tTt + λ 2 aTKa. (',\n",

KERNEL METHODS If we substitute this back into the linear regression model, we obtain the following prediction for a new input x y(x) = wTφ(x) = aTΦφ(x) = k(x)T (K + λIN)−1 t (6.9) where we have deﬁned the vector k(x) with elements kn(x) = k(xn, x). Thus we see that the dual formulation allows the solution to the least-squares problem to be expressed entirely in terms of the kernel function k(x, x′). This is known as a dual formulation because, by noting that the solution for a can be expressed as a linear combination of the elements of φ(x), we recover the original formulation in terms of the parameter vector w. Note that the prediction at x is given by a linear combination Exercise 6.1 of the target values from the training set. In fact, we have already obtained this result, using a slightly different notation, in Section 3.3.3. In the dual formulation, we determine the parameter vector a by inverting an N × N matrix, whereas in the original parameter space formulation we had to invert an M × M matrix in order to determine w. Because N is typically much larger than M, the dual formulation does not seem to be particularly useful. However, the advantage of the dual formulation, as we shall see, is that it is expressed entirely in terms of the kernel function k(x, x′). We can therefore work directly in terms of kernels and avoid the explicit introduction of the feature vector φ(x), which allows us implicitly to use feature spaces of high, even inﬁnite, dimensionality. The existence of a dual representation based on the Gram matrix is a property of many linear models, including the perceptron. In Section 6.4, we will develop a dual- Exercise 6.2 ity between probabilistic linear models for regression and the technique of Gaussian processes. Duality will also play an important role when we discuss support vector machines in Chapter 7.',\n",

Constructing Kernels In order to exploit kernel substitution, we need to be able to construct valid kernel functions. One approach is to choose a feature space mapping φ(x) and then use this to ﬁnd the corresponding kernel, as is illustrated in Figure 6.1. Here the kernel function is deﬁned for a one-dimensional input space by k(x, x′) = φ(x)Tφ(x′) = M \\x02 i=1 φi(x)φi(x′) (6.10) where φi(x) are the basis functions.

A necessary and sufﬁcient condition for a function k(x, x′) to be a valid kernel (Shawe- Taylor and Cristianini, 2004) is that the Gram matrix K, whose elements are given by k(xn, xm), should be positive semideﬁnite for all possible choices of the set {xn}. Note that a positive semideﬁnite matrix is not the same thing as a matrix whose elements are nonnegative.

Given valid kernels k1(x, x′) and k2(x, x′), the following new kernels will also be valid: k(x, x′) = ck1(x, x′) (6.13) k(x, x′) = f(x)k1(x, x′)f(x′) (6.14) k(x, x′) = q (k1(x, x′)) (6.15) k(x, x′) = exp (k1(x, x′)) (6.16) k(x, x′) = k1(x, x′) + k2(x, x′) (6.17) k(x, x′) = k1(x, x′)k2(x, x′) (6.18) k(x, x′) = k3 (φ(x), φ(x′)) (6.19) k(x, x′) = xTAx′ (6.20) k(x, x′) = ka(xa, x′ a) + kb(xb, x′ b) (6.21) k(x, x′) = ka(xa, x′ a)kb(xb, x′ b) (6.22) where c > 0 is a constant, f(·) is any function, q(·) is a polynomial with nonneg- ative coefﬁcients, φ(x) is a function from x to RM, k3(·, ·) is a valid kernel in RM, A is a symmetric positive semideﬁnite matrix, xa and xb are variables (not necessarily disjoint) with x = (xa, xb), and ka and kb are valid kernel functions over their respective spaces. Equipped with these properties, we can now embark on the construction of more complex kernels appropriate to speciﬁc applications. We require that the kernel k(x, x′) be symmetric and positive semideﬁnite and that it expresses the appropriate form of similarity between x and x′ according to the intended application. Here we consider a few common examples of kernel functions. For a more extensive discus- sion of ‘kernel engineering’, see Shawe-Taylor and Cristianini (2004). We saw that the simple polynomial kernel k(x, x′) = xTx′\\x0b2 contains only terms of degree two. If we consider the slightly generalized kernel k(x, x′) = xTx′ + c\\x0b2 with c > 0, then the corresponding feature mapping φ(x) contains con- stant and linear terms as well as terms of order two. Similarly, k(x, x′) = xTx′\\x0bM contains all monomials of order M. For instance, if x and x′ are two images, then the kernel represents a particular weighted sum of all possible products of M pixels in the ﬁrst image with M pixels in the second image. This can similarly be gener- alized to include all terms up to degree M by considering k(x, x′) = xTx′ + c \\x0bM with c > 0.',\n",

Note that the feature vector that corresponds to the Gaussian kernel has inﬁnite dimensionality. Exercise 6.11 The Gaussian kernel is not restricted to the use of Euclidean distance. If we use kernel substitution in (6.24) to replace xTx′ with a nonlinear kernel κ(x, x′), we obtain k(x, x′) = exp \\x0c −1 2σ2 (κ(x, x) + κ(x′, x′) −2κ(x, x′)) \\r . (6.26) An important contribution to arise from the kernel viewpoint has been the exten- sion to inputs that are symbolic, rather than simply vectors of real numbers. Kernel functions can be deﬁned over objects as diverse as graphs, sets, strings, and text doc- uments. Consider, for instance, a ﬁxed set and deﬁne a nonvectorial space consisting of all possible subsets of this set. If A1 and A2 are two such subsets then one simple choice of kernel would be k(A1, A2) = 2|A1∩A2| (6.27) where A1 ∩A2 denotes the intersection of sets A1 and A2, and |A| denotes the number of subsets in A. This is a valid kernel function because it can be shown to correspond to an inner product in a feature space. Exercise 6.12 One powerful approach to the construction of kernels starts from a probabilistic generative model (Haussler, 1999), which allows us to apply generative models in a discriminative setting. Generative models can deal naturally with missing data and in the case of hidden Markov models can handle sequences of varying length.',\n",

By contrast, discriminative models generally give better performance on discriminative tasks than generative models. It is therefore of some interest to combine these two approaches (Lasserre et al.,2006). One way to combine them is to use a generative model to deﬁne a kernel, and then use this kernel in a discriminative approach. Given a generative model p(x) we can deﬁne a kernel by k(x, x′) = p(x)p(x′). (6.28) This is clearly a valid kernel function because we can interpret it as an inner product in the one-dimensional feature space deﬁned by the mapping p(x). It says that two inputs x and x′ are similar if they both have high probabilities. We can use (6.13) and (6.17) to extend this class of kernels by considering sums over products of different probability distributions, with positive weighting coefﬁcients p(i), of the form k(x, x′) = \\x02 i p(x|i)p(x′|i)p(i).

KERNEL METHODS This is equivalent, up to an overall multiplicative constant, to a mixture distribution in which the components factorize, with the index i playing the role of a ‘latent’ variable. Two inputs x and x′ will give a large value for the kernel function, and Section 9.2 hence appear similar, if they have signiﬁcant probability under a range of different components. Taking the limit of an inﬁnite sum, we can also consider kernels of the form k(x, x′) = \\x06 p(x|z)p(x′|z)p(z) dz (6.30) where z is a continuous latent variable. Now suppose that our data consists of ordered sequences of length L so that an observation is given by X = {x1, . . . ,xL}. A popular generative model for sequences is the hidden Markov model, which expresses the distribution p(X) as a Section 13.2 marginalization over a corresponding sequence of hidden states Z = {z1, . . . ,zL}. We can use this approach to deﬁne a kernel function measuring the similarity of two sequences X and X′ by extending the mixture representation (6.29) to give k(X, X′) = \\x02 Z p(X|Z)p(X′|Z)p(Z) (6.31) so that both observed sequences are generated by the same hidden sequence Z. This model can easily be extended to allow sequences of differing length to be compared. An alternative technique for using generative models to deﬁne kernel functions is known as the Fisher kernel (Jaakkola and Haussler, 1999).

In particular, they consider the Fisher score g(θ, x) = ∇θ ln p(x|θ) (6.32) from which the Fisher kernel is deﬁned by k(x, x′) = g(θ, x)TF−1g(θ, x′).

(6.36) An application of Fisher kernels to document retrieval is given by Hofmann (2000). A ﬁnal example of a kernel function is the sigmoidal kernel given by k(x, x′) = tanh axTx′ + b \\x0b (6.37) whose Gram matrix in general is not positive semideﬁnite. This form of kernel has, however, been used in practice (Vapnik, 1995), possibly because it gives kernel expansions such as the support vector machine a superﬁcial resemblance to neural network models. As we shall see, in the limit of an inﬁnite number of basis functions, a Bayesian neural network with an appropriate prior reduces to a Gaussian process, thereby providing a deeper link between neural networks and kernel methods. Section 6.4.7 6.3. Radial Basis Function Networks In Chapter 3, we discussed regression models based on linear combinations of ﬁxed basis functions, although we did not discuss in detail what form those basis functions might take. One choice that has been widely used is that of radial basis functions, which have the property that each basis function depends only on the radial distance (typically Euclidean) from a centre µj, so that φj(x) = h(∥x −µj∥). Historically, radial basis functions were introduced for the purpose of exact func- tion interpolation (Powell, 1987).',\n",

This is achieved by expressing f(x) as a linear combination of radial basis functions, one centred on every data point f(x) = N \\x02 n=1 wnh(∥x −xn∥). (6.38) The values of the coefﬁcients {wn} are found by least squares, and because there are the same number of coefﬁcients as there are constraints, the result is a function that ﬁts every target value exactly. In pattern recognition applications, however, the target values are generally noisy, and exact interpolation is undesirable because this corresponds to an over-ﬁtted solution. Expansions in radial basis functions also arise from regularization theory (Pog- gio and Girosi, 1990; Bishop, 1995a). For a sum-of-squares error function with a regularizer deﬁned in terms of a differential operator, the optimal solution is given by an expansion in the Green’s functions of the operator (which are analogous to the eigenvectors of a discrete matrix), again with one basis function centred on each data',\n",

Due to the presence of the regularizer, the solution no longer interpolates the training data exactly. Another motivation for radial basis functions comes from a consideration of the interpolation problem when the input (rather than the target) variables are noisy (Webb, 1994; Bishop, 1995a). If the noise on the input variable x is described by a variable ξ having a distribution ν(ξ), then the sum-of-squares error function becomes E = 1 2 N \\x02 n=1 \\x06 {y(xn + ξ) −tn}2 ν(ξ) dξ.

(6.41) We see that there is one basis function centred on every data point. This is known as the Nadaraya-Watson model and will be derived again from a different perspective in Section 6.3.1. If the noise distribution ν(ξ) is isotropic, so that it is a function only of ∥ξ∥, then the basis functions will be radial.

Another situation in which expansions in normalized radial basis functions arise is in the application of kernel density estimation to the problem of regression, as we shall discuss in Section 6.3.1. Because there is one basis function associated with every data point, the corre- sponding model can be computationally costly to evaluate when making predictions for new data points. Models have therefore been proposed (Broomhead and Lowe, 1988; Moody and Darken, 1989; Poggio and Girosi, 1990), which retain the expan- sion in radial basis functions but where the number M of basis functions is smaller than the number N of data points. Typically, the number of basis functions, and the locations µi of their centres, are determined based on the input data {xn} alone.

One of the simplest ways of choosing basis function centres is to use a randomly chosen subset of the data points. A more systematic approach is called orthogonal least squares (Chen et al.,1991). This is a sequential selection process in which at each step the next data point to be chosen as a basis function centre corresponds to the one that gives the greatest reduction in the sum-of-squares error. Values for the expansion coefﬁcients are determined as part of the algorithm. Clustering algorithms such as K-means have also been used, which give a set of basis function centres that Section 9.1 no longer coincide with training data points.6.3.1 Nadaraya-Watson model In Section 3.3.3, we saw that the prediction of a linear regression model for a new input x takes the form of a linear combination of the training set target values with coefﬁcients given by the ‘equivalent kernel’ (3.62) where the equivalent kernel satisﬁes the summation constraint (3.64).

In Chapter 3, we considered linear regression models of the form y(x, w) = wTφ(x) in which w is a vector of parameters and φ(x) is a vector of ﬁxed nonlinear basis functions that depend on the input vector x. We showed that a prior distribution over w induced a corresponding prior distribution over functions y(x, w). Given a training data set, we then evaluated the posterior distribution over w and thereby obtained the corresponding posterior distribution over regression functions, which in turn (with the addition of noise) implies a predictive distribution p(t|x) for new input vectors x. In the Gaussian process viewpoint, we dispense with the parametric model and instead deﬁne a prior probability distribution over functions directly. At ﬁrst sight, it might seem difﬁcult to work with a distribution over the uncountably inﬁnite space of functions. However, as we shall see, for a ﬁnite training set we only need to consider the values of the function at the discrete set of input values xn corresponding to the training set and test set data points, and so in practice we can work in a ﬁnite space. Models equivalent to Gaussian processes have been widely studied in many dif- ferent ﬁelds. For instance, in the geostatistics literature Gaussian process regression is known as kriging (Cressie, 1993). Similarly, ARMA (autoregressive moving aver- age) models, Kalman ﬁlters, and radial basis function networks can all be viewed as forms of Gaussian process models. Reviews of Gaussian processes from a machine learning perspective can be found in MacKay (1998), Williams (1999), and MacKay (2003), and a comparison of Gaussian process models with alternative approaches is given in Rasmussen (1996).',\n",

This will provide a speciﬁc example of a Gaussian process. Consider a model deﬁned in terms of a linear combination of M ﬁxed basis functions given by the elements of the vector φ(x) so that y(x) = wTφ(x) (6.49) where x is the input vector and w is the M-dimensional weight vector. Now consider a prior distribution over w given by an isotropic Gaussian of the form p(w) = N(w|0, α−1I) (6.50) governed by the hyperparameter α, which represents the precision (inverse variance) of the distribution. For any given value of w, the deﬁnition (6.49) deﬁnes a partic- ular function of x. The probability distribution over w deﬁned by (6.50) therefore induces a probability distribution over functions y(x). In practice, we wish to eval- uate this function at speciﬁc values of x, for example at the training data points',\n",

We are therefore interested in the joint distribution of the function val- ues y(x1), . . . ,y(xN), which we denote by the vector y with elements yn = y(xn) for n = 1, . . . ,N. From (6.49), this vector is given by y = Φw (6.51) where Φ is the design matrix with elements Φnk = φk(xn). We can ﬁnd the proba- bility distribution of y as follows. First of all we note that y is a linear combination of Gaussian distributed variables given by the elements of w and hence is itself Gaus- sian. We therefore need only to ﬁnd its mean and covariance, which are given from Exercise 2.31 (6.50) by E[y] = ΦE[w] = 0 (6.52) cov[y] = E \\x08 yyT\\t = ΦE \\x08 wwT\\t ΦT = 1 αΦΦT = K (6.53) where K is the Gram matrix with elements Knm = k(xn, xm) = 1 αφ(xn)Tφ(xm) (6.54) and k(x, x′) is the kernel function.

More generally, a stochastic process y(x) is speciﬁed by giving the joint probability distribution for any ﬁnite set of values y(x1), . . . ,y(xN) in a consistent manner. A key point about Gaussian stochastic processes is that the joint distribution over N variables y1, . . . ,yN is speciﬁed completely by the second-order statistics, namely the mean and the covariance. In most applications, we will not have any prior knowledge about the mean of y(x) and so by symmetry we take it to be zero. This is equivalent to choosing the mean of the prior over weight values p(w|α) to be zero in the basis function viewpoint. The speciﬁcation of the Gaussian process is then completed by giving the covariance of y(x) evaluated at any two values of x, which is given by the kernel function E [y(xn)y(xm)] = k(xn, xm).

Here we shall consider noise processes that have a Gaussian distribution, so that p(tn|yn) = N(tn|yn, β−1) (6.58) where β is a hyperparameter representing the precision of the noise. Because the noise is independent for each data point, the joint distribution of the target values t = (t1, . . . ,tN)T conditioned on the values of y = (y1, . . . ,yN)T is given by an isotropic Gaussian of the form p(t|y) = N(t|y, β−1IN) (6.59) where IN denotes the N ×N unit matrix. From the deﬁnition of a Gaussian process, the marginal distribution p(y) is given by a Gaussian whose mean is zero and whose covariance is deﬁned by a Gram matrix K so that p(y) = N(y|0, K). (6.60) The kernel function that determines K is typically chosen to express the property that, for points xn and xm that are similar, the corresponding values y(xn) and y(xm) will be more strongly correlated than for dissimilar points. Here the notion of similarity will depend on the application. In order to ﬁnd the marginal distribution p(t), conditioned on the input values x1, . . . ,xN, we need to integrate over y.

In practice, rather than ﬁxing the covariance function, we may prefer to use a parametric family of functions and then infer the parameter values from the data. These parameters govern such things as the length scale of the correlations and the precision of the noise and correspond to the hyperparameters in a standard parametric model. Techniques for learning the hyperparameters are based on the evaluation of the likelihood function p(t|θ) where θ denotes the hyperparameters of the Gaussian pro- cess model. The simplest approach is to make a point estimate of θ by maximizing the log likelihood function. Because θ represents a set of hyperparameters for the regression problem, this can be viewed as analogous to the type 2 maximum like- lihood procedure for linear regression models. Maximization of the log likelihood Section 3.5 can be done using efﬁcient gradient-based optimization algorithms such as conjugate gradients (Fletcher, 1987; Nocedal and Wright, 1999; Bishop and Nabney, 2008). The log likelihood function for a Gaussian process regression model is easily evaluated using the standard form for a multivariate Gaussian distribution, giving ln p(t|θ) = −1 2 ln |CN| −1 2tTC−1 N t −N 2 ln(2π).

In a fully Bayesian treatment, we need to evaluate marginals over θ weighted by the product of the prior p(θ) and the likelihood func- tion p(t|θ). In general, however, exact marginalization will be intractable, and we must resort to approximations. The Gaussian process regression model gives a predictive distribution whose mean and variance are functions of the input vector x. However, we have assumed that the contribution to the predictive variance arising from the additive noise, gov- erned by the parameter β, is a constant. For some problems, known as heteroscedas- tic, the noise variance itself will also depend on x. To model this, we can extend the',\n",

This technique can usefully be extended by incorporating a separate parameter for each input variable (Rasmussen and Williams, 2006). The result, as we shall see, is that the optimization of these parameters by maximum likelihood allows the relative importance of different inputs to be inferred from the data. This represents an exam- ple in the Gaussian process context of automatic relevance determination, or ARD, which was originally formulated in the framework of neural networks (MacKay, 1994; Neal, 1996).

To do this we introduce a Gaussian process prior over the vector aN+1, which has compo- nents a(x1), . . . ,a(xN+1). This in turn deﬁnes a non-Gaussian process over tN+1, and by conditioning on the training data tN we obtain the required predictive distri- bution.

This integral is analytically intractable, and so may be approximated using sam- pling methods (Neal, 1997). Alternatively, we can consider techniques based on an analytical approximation. In Section 4.5.2, we derived the approximate formula (4.153) for the convolution of a logistic sigmoid with a Gaussian distribution. We can use this result to evaluate the integral in (6.76) provided we have a Gaussian approximation to the posterior distribution p(aN+1|tN). The usual justiﬁcation for a Gaussian approximation to a posterior distribution is that the true posterior will tend to a Gaussian as the number of data points increases as a consequence of the central limit theorem. In the case of Gaussian processes, the number of variables grows with Section 2.3 the number of data points, and so this argument does not apply directly. However, if we consider increasing the number of data points falling in a ﬁxed region of x space, then the corresponding uncertainty in the function a(x) will decrease, again leading asymptotically to a Gaussian (Williams and Barber, 1998). Three different approaches to obtaining a Gaussian approximation have been considered.

The approach also yields a lower bound on the likelihood function p(tN|θ). The variational framework for Gaussian process classiﬁcation can also be extended to multiclass (K > 2) problems by using a Gaussian approximation to the softmax function (Gibbs, 1997). A second approach uses expectation propagation (Opper and Winther, 2000b; Section 10.7 Minka, 2001b; Seeger, 2003). Because the true posterior distribution is unimodal, as we shall see shortly, the expectation propagation approach can give good results.6.4.6 Laplace approximation The third approach to Gaussian process classiﬁcation is based on the Laplace approximation, which we now consider in detail. In order to evaluate the predictive Section 4.4 distribution (6.76), we seek a Gaussian approximation to the posterior distribution over aN+1, which, using Bayes’ theorem, is given by p(aN+1|tN) = \\x06 p(aN+1, aN|tN) daN = 1 p(tN) \\x06 p(aN+1, aN)p(tN|aN+1, aN) daN = 1 p(tN) \\x06 p(aN+1|aN)p(aN)p(tN|aN) daN = \\x06 p(aN+1|aN)p(aN|tN) daN (6.77)',\n",

The conditional distribution p(aN+1|aN) is obtained by invoking the results (6.66) and (6.67) for Gaussian pro- cess regression, to give p(aN+1|aN) = N(aN+1|kTC−1 N aN, c −kTC−1 N k). (6.78) We can therefore evaluate the integral in (6.77) by ﬁnding a Laplace approximation for the posterior distribution p(aN|tN), and then using the standard result for the convolution of two Gaussian distributions. The prior p(aN) is given by a zero-mean Gaussian process with covariance ma- trix CN, and the data term (assuming independence of the data points) is given by p(tN|aN) = N \\x0e n=1 σ(an)tn(1 −σ(an))1−tn = N \\x0e n=1 eantnσ(−an). (6.79) We then obtain the Laplace approximation by Taylor expanding the logarithm of p(aN|tN), which up to an additive normalization constant is given by the quantity Ψ(aN) = ln p(aN) + ln p(tN|aN) = −1 2aT NC−1 N aN −N 2 ln(2π) −1 2 ln |CN| + tT NaN − N \\x02 n=1 ln(1 + ean) + const. (6.80) First we need to ﬁnd the mode of the posterior distribution, and this requires that we evaluate the gradient of Ψ(aN), which is given by ∇Ψ(aN) = tN −σN −C−1 N aN (6.81) where σN is a vector with elements σ(an). We cannot simply ﬁnd the mode by setting this gradient to zero, because σN depends nonlinearly on aN, and so we resort to an iterative scheme based on the Newton-Raphson method, which gives rise to an iterative reweighted least squares (IRLS) algorithm. This requires the second Section 4.3.3 derivatives of Ψ(aN), which we also require for the Laplace approximation anyway, and which are given by ∇∇Ψ(aN) = −WN −C−1 N (6.82) where WN is a diagonal matrix with elements σ(an)(1 −σ(an)), and we have used the result (4.88) for the derivative of the logistic sigmoid function. Note that these diagonal elements lie in the range (0, 1/4), and hence WN is a positive deﬁnite matrix. Because CN (and hence its inverse) is positive deﬁnite by construction, and because the sum of two positive deﬁnite matrices is also positive deﬁnite, we see Exercise 6.24 that the Hessian matrix A = −∇∇Ψ(aN) is positive deﬁnite and so the posterior distribution p(aN|tN) is log convex and therefore has a single mode that is the global',\n",

(6.83) These equations are iterated until they converge to the mode which we denote by a⋆ N. At the mode, the gradient ∇Ψ(aN) will vanish, and hence a⋆ N will satisfy a⋆ N = CN(tN −σN). (6.84) Once we have found the mode a⋆ N of the posterior, we can evaluate the Hessian matrix given by H = −∇∇Ψ(aN) = WN + C−1 N (6.85) where the elements of WN are evaluated using a⋆ N. This deﬁnes our Gaussian ap- proximation to the posterior distribution p(aN|tN) given by q(aN) = N(aN|a⋆ N, H−1). (6.86) We can now combine this with (6.78) and hence evaluate the integral (6.77).

Thus, when we differentiate (6.90) with respect to θ, we obtain two sets of terms, the ﬁrst arising from the dependence of the covariance matrix CN on θ, and the rest arising from dependence of a⋆ N on θ.

In the framework of maximum likelihood, the number of hidden units needs to be limited (to a level dependent on the size of the training set) in order to avoid over-ﬁtting. However, from a Bayesian perspective it makes little sense to limit the number of parameters in the network according to the size of the training set. In a Bayesian neural network, the prior distribution over the parameter vector w, in conjunction with the network function f(x, w), produces a prior distribution over functions from y(x) where y is the vector of network outputs. Neal (1996) has shown that, for a broad class of prior distributions over w, the distribution of functions generated by a neural network will tend to a Gaussian process in the limit M →∞. It should be noted, however, that in this limit the output variables of the neural network become independent. One of the great merits of neural networks is that the outputs share the hidden units and so they can ‘borrow statistical strength’ from each other, that is, the weights associated with each hidden unit are inﬂuenced by all of the output variables not just by one of them. This property is therefore lost in the Gaussian process limit. We have seen that a Gaussian process is determined by its covariance (kernel) function.',\n",

If the weight prior is governed by hyperpa- rameters, then their values will determine the length scales of the distribution over functions, as can be understood by studying the examples in Figure 5.11 for the case of a ﬁnite number of hidden units. Note that we cannot marginalize out the hyperpa- rameters analytically, and must instead resort to techniques of the kind discussed in Section 6.4.

One of the signiﬁcant limitations of many such algorithms is that the kernel function k(xn, xm) must be evaluated for all possible pairs xn and xm of training points, which can be computationally infeasible during training and can lead to excessive computation times when making predictions for new data points. In this chapter we shall look at kernel-based algorithms that have sparse solutions, so that predictions for new inputs depend only on the kernel function evaluated at a subset of the training data points. We begin by looking in some detail at the support vector machine (SVM), which became popular in some years ago for solving problems in classiﬁcation, regression, and novelty detection. An important property of support vector machines is that the determination of the model parameters corresponds to a convex optimization prob- lem, and so any local solution is also a global optimum.

We have already discussed some of the beneﬁts of determining probabilities in Sec- tion 1.5.4. An alternative sparse kernel technique, known as the relevance vector machine (RVM), is based on a Bayesian formulation and provides posterior proba- Section 7.2 bilistic outputs, as well as having typically much sparser solutions than the SVM.7.1. Maximum Margin Classiﬁers We begin our discussion of support vector machines by returning to the two-class classiﬁcation problem using linear models of the form y(x) = wTφ(x) + b (7.1) where φ(x) denotes a ﬁxed feature-space transformation, and we have made the bias parameter b explicit.

We shall assume for the moment that the training data set is linearly separable in feature space, so that by deﬁnition there exists at least one choice of the parameters w and b such that a function of the form (7.1) satisﬁes y(xn) > 0 for points having tn = +1 and y(xn) < 0 for points having tn = −1, so that tny(xn) > 0 for all training data points. There may of course exist many such solutions that separate the classes exactly. In Section 4.1.7, we described the perceptron algorithm that is guaranteed to ﬁnd a solution in a ﬁnite number of steps. The solution that it ﬁnds, however, will be dependent on the (arbitrary) initial values chosen for w and b as well as on the order in which the data points are presented. If there are multiple solutions all of which classify the training data set exactly, then we should try to ﬁnd the one that will give the smallest generalization error. The support vector machine approaches this problem through the concept of the margin, which is deﬁned to be the smallest distance between the decision boundary and any of the samples, as illustrated in Figure 7.1. In support vector machines the decision boundary is chosen to be the one for which the margin is maximized. The maximum margin solution can be motivated us- ing computational learning theory, also known as statistical learning theory.

Together with the class priors, this deﬁnes an opti- mal misclassiﬁcation-rate decision boundary. However, instead of using this optimal boundary, they determine the best hyperplane by minimizing the probability of error relative to the learned density model. In the limit σ2 →0, the optimal hyperplane is shown to be the one having maximum margin. The intuition behind this result is that as σ2 is reduced, the hyperplane is increasingly dominated by nearby data points relative to more distant ones. In the limit, the hyperplane becomes independent of data points that are not support vectors.

Direct solution of this optimization problem would be very complex, and so we shall convert it into an equivalent problem that is much easier to solve. To do this we note that if we make the rescaling w →κw and b →κb, then the distance from any point xn to the decision surface, given by tny(xn)/∥w∥, is unchanged. We can use this freedom to set tn wTφ(xn) + b \\x0b = 1 (7.4) for the point that is closest to the surface. In this case, all data points will satisfy the constraints tn wTφ(xn) + b\\x0b ⩾1, n = 1, . . . ,N. (7.5) This is known as the canonical representation of the decision hyperplane. In the case of data points for which the equality holds, the constraints are said to be active, whereas for the remainder they are said to be inactive. By deﬁnition, there will always be at least one active constraint, because there will always be a closest point, and once the margin has been maximized there will be at least two active constraints.

For a ﬁxed set of basis functions whose number M is smaller than the number N of data points, the move to the dual problem appears disadvantageous. However, it allows the model to be reformulated using kernels, and so the maximum margin classiﬁer can be applied efﬁciently to feature spaces whose dimensionality exceeds the number of data points, including inﬁnite feature spaces.

By the age of nineteen, he had already made important contributions mathemat- ics and had been appointed as Pro- fessor at the Royal Artillery School in Turin. For many years, Euler worked hard to persuade Lagrange to move to Berlin, which he eventually did in 1766 where he succeeded Euler as Director of Mathematics at the Berlin Academy. Later he moved to Paris, nar- rowly escaping with his life during the French revo- lution thanks to the personal intervention of Lavoisier (the French chemist who discovered oxygen) who him- self was later executed at the guillotine.

(7.16) Thus for every data point, either an = 0 or tny(xn) = 1. Any data point for which an = 0 will not appear in the sum in (7.13) and hence plays no role in making predictions for new data points. The remaining data points are called support vectors, and because they satisfy tny(xn) = 1, they correspond to points that lie on the maximum margin hyperplanes in feature space, as illustrated in Figure 7.1. This property is central to the practical applicability of support vector machines. Once the model is trained, a signiﬁcant proportion of the data points can be discarded and only the support vectors retained. Having solved the quadratic programming problem and found a value for a, we can then determine the value of the threshold parameter b by noting that any support vector xn satisﬁes tny(xn) = 1. Using (7.13) this gives tn \\x16\\x02 m∈S amtmk(xn, xm) + b \\x17 = 1 (7.17) where S denotes the set of indices of the support vectors.

Although the data set is not linearly separable in the two-dimensional data space x, it is linearly separable in the nonlinear feature space deﬁned implicitly by the nonlinear kernel function. Thus the training data points are perfectly separated in the original data space. This example also provides a geometrical insight into the origin of sparsity in the SVM. The maximum margin hyperplane is deﬁned by the location of the support vectors. Other data points can be moved around freely (so long as they remain out- side the margin region) without changing the decision boundary, and so the solution will be independent of such data points.7.1.1 Overlapping class distributions So far, we have assumed that the training data points are linearly separable in the feature space φ(x).

From (7.19) we see that in the case of separable classes, we implicitly used an error function that gave inﬁnite error if a data point was misclassiﬁed and zero error if it was classiﬁed correctly, and then optimized the model parameters to maximize the margin. We now modify this approach so that data points are allowed to be on the ‘wrong side’ of the margin boundary, but with a penalty that increases with the distance from that boundary. For the subsequent optimization problem, it is convenient to make this penalty a linear function of this distance. To do this, we introduce slack variables, ξn ⩾0 where n = 1, . . . ,N, with one slack variable for each training data point (Bennett, 1992; Cortes and Vapnik, 1995). These are deﬁned by ξn = 0 for data points that are on or inside the correct margin boundary and ξn = |tn −y(xn)| for other points.

We ﬁrst note that the objective function \\x04L(a) given by (7.10) or (7.32) is quadratic and so any local optimum will also be a global optimum provided the constraints deﬁne a convex region (which they do as a conse- quence of being linear). Direct solution of the quadratic programming problem us- ing traditional techniques is often infeasible due to the demanding computation and memory requirements, and so more practical approaches need to be found. The tech- nique of chunking (Vapnik, 1982) exploits the fact that the value of the Lagrangian is unchanged if we remove the rows and columns of the kernel matrix corresponding to Lagrange multipliers that have value zero. This allows the full quadratic pro- gramming problem to be broken down into a series of smaller ones, whose goal is eventually to identify all of the nonzero Lagrange multipliers and discard the others. Chunking can be implemented using protected conjugate gradients (Burges, 1998). Although chunking reduces the size of the matrix in the quadratic function from the number of data points squared to approximately the number of nonzero Lagrange multipliers squared, even this may be too big to ﬁt in memory for large-scale appli- cations.

However, it still involves numerical solution of quadratic programming subproblems and these can be problematic and expensive. One of the most popular approaches to training support vector machines is called sequential minimal optimization, or SMO (Platt, 1999). It takes the concept of chunking to the extreme limit and considers just two Lagrange multipliers at a time. In this case, the subproblem can be solved analyti- cally, thereby avoiding numerical quadratic programming altogether. Heuristics are given for choosing the pair of Lagrange multipliers to be considered at each step. In practice, SMO is found to have a scaling with the number of data points that is somewhere between linear and quadratic depending on the particular application. We have seen that kernel functions correspond to inner products in feature spaces that can have high, or even inﬁnite, dimensionality.

This is not the case, however, because there are constraints amongst Section 1.4 the feature values that restrict the effective dimensionality of feature space. To see this consider a simple second-order polynomial kernel that we can expand in terms of its components k(x, z) = 1 + xTz\\x0b2 = (1 + x1z1 + x2z2)2 = 1 + 2x1z1 + 2x2z2 + x2 1z2 1 + 2x1z1x2z2 + x2 2z2 2 = (1, √ 2x1, √ 2x2, x2 1, √ 2x1x2, x2 2)(1, √ 2z1, √ 2z2, z2 1, √ 2z1z2, z2 2)T = φ(x)Tφ(z). (7.42) This kernel function therefore represents an inner product in a feature space having six dimensions, in which the mapping from input space to feature space is described by the vector function φ(x). However, the coefﬁcients weighting these different features are constrained to have speciﬁc forms. Thus any set of points in the original two-dimensional space x would be constrained to lie exactly on a two-dimensional nonlinear manifold embedded in the six-dimensional feature space. We have already highlighted the fact that the support vector machine does not provide probabilistic outputs but instead makes classiﬁcation decisions for new in- put vectors. Veropoulos et al.

To address this issue, Platt (2000) has proposed ﬁtting a logistic sigmoid to the outputs of a previously trained support vector machine. Speciﬁcally, the required conditional probability is assumed to be of the form p(t = 1|x) = σ (Ay(x) + B) (7.43) where y(x) is deﬁned by (7.1). Values for the parameters A and B are found by minimizing the cross-entropy error function deﬁned by a training set consisting of pairs of values y(xn) and tn. The data used to ﬁt the sigmoid needs to be independent of that used to train the original SVM in order to avoid severe over-ﬁtting. This two- stage approach is equivalent to assuming that the output y(x) of the support vector machine represents the log-odds of x belonging to class t = 1. Because the SVM training procedure is not speciﬁcally intended to encourage this, the SVM can give a poor approximation to the posterior probabilities (Tipping, 2001).7.1.2 Relation to logistic regression As with the separable case, we can re-cast the SVM for nonseparable distri- butions in terms of the minimization of a regularized error function.

For comparison with the support vector machine, we ﬁrst reformulate maximum likelihood logistic regression using the target variable t ∈{−1, 1}. To do this, we note that p(t = 1|y) = σ(y) where y(x) is given by (7.1), and σ(y) is the logistic sigmoid function deﬁned by (4.59).

This rescaled error function is also plotted in Figure 7.5 and we see that it has a similar form to the support vector error function. The key difference is that the ﬂat region in ESV(yt) leads to sparse solutions. Both the logistic error and the hinge loss can be viewed as continuous approx- imations to the misclassiﬁcation error. Another continuous error function that has sometimes been used to solve classiﬁcation problems is the squared error, which is again plotted in Figure 7.5. It has the property, however, of placing increasing emphasis on data points that are correctly classiﬁed but that are a long way from the decision boundary on the correct side. Such points will be strongly weighted at the expense of misclassiﬁed points, and so if the objective is to minimize the mis- classiﬁcation rate, then a monotonically decreasing error function would be a better choice.7.1.3 Multiclass SVMs The support vector machine is fundamentally a two-class classiﬁer.

However, in Figure 4.2 we saw that using the decisions of the individual classiﬁers can lead to inconsistent results in which an input is assigned to multiple classes simultaneously. This problem is sometimes addressed by making predictions for new inputs x using y(x) = max k yk(x). (7.49) Unfortunately, this heuristic approach suffers from the problem that the different classiﬁers were trained on different tasks, and there is no guarantee that the real- valued quantities yk(x) for different classiﬁers will have appropriate scales. Another problem with the one-versus-the-rest approach is that the training sets are imbalanced. For instance, if we have ten classes each with equal numbers of training data points, then the individual classiﬁers are trained on data sets comprising 90% negative examples and only 10% positive examples, and the symmetry of the original problem is lost. A variant of the one-versus-the-rest scheme was proposed by Lee et al. (2001) who modify the target values so that the positive class has target +1 and the negative class has target −1/(K −1). Weston and Watkins (1999) deﬁne a single objective function for training all K SVMs simultaneously, based on maximizing the margin from each to remaining classes.',\n",

Maximum Margin Classiﬁers 339 Another approach is to train K(K −1)/2 different 2-class SVMs on all possible pairs of classes, and then to classify test points according to which class has the high- est number of ‘votes’, an approach that is sometimes called one-versus-one. Again, we saw in Figure 4.2 that this can lead to ambiguities in the resulting classiﬁcation. Also, for large K this approach requires signiﬁcantly more training time than the one-versus-the-rest approach. Similarly, to evaluate test points, signiﬁcantly more computation is required. The latter problem can be alleviated by organizing the pairwise classiﬁers into a directed acyclic graph (not to be confused with a probabilistic graphical model) leading to the DAGSVM (Platt et al.,2000). For K classes, the DAGSVM has a total of K(K −1)/2 classiﬁers, and to classify a new test point only K −1 pairwise classiﬁers need to be evaluated, with the particular classiﬁers used depending on which path through the graph is traversed. A different approach to multiclass classiﬁcation, based on error-correcting out- put codes, was developed by Dietterich and Bakiri (1995) and applied to support vector machines by Allwein et al. (2000). This can be viewed as a generalization of the voting scheme of the one-versus-one approach in which more general partitions of the classes are used to train the individual classiﬁers.',\n",

The K classes themselves are represented as particular sets of responses from the two-class classiﬁers chosen, and together with a suitable decoding scheme, this gives robustness to errors and to ambiguity in the outputs of the individual classiﬁers. Although the application of SVMs to multiclass classiﬁcation problems remains an open issue, in practice the one-versus-the-rest approach is the most widely used in spite of its ad-hoc formula- tion and its practical limitations. There are also single-class support vector machines, which solve an unsuper- vised learning problem related to probability density estimation. Instead of mod- elling the density of data, however, these methods aim to ﬁnd a smooth boundary enclosing a region of high density. The boundary is chosen to represent a quantile of the density, that is, the probability that a data point drawn from the distribution will land inside that region is given by a ﬁxed number between 0 and 1 that is speciﬁed in advance. This is a more restricted problem than estimating the full density but may be sufﬁcient in speciﬁc applications. Two approaches to this problem using support vector machines have been proposed. The algorithm of Sch¨olkopf et al. (2001) tries to ﬁnd a hyperplane that separates all but a ﬁxed fraction ν of the training data from the origin while at the same time maximizing the distance (margin) of the hyperplane from the origin, while Tax and Duin (1999) look for the smallest sphere in feature space that contains all but a fraction ν of the data points.

A simple example of an ϵ-insensitive error function, having a linear cost associated with errors outside the insensitive region, is given by Eϵ(y(x) −t) = \\x0c 0, if |y(x) −t| < ϵ; |y(x) −t| −ϵ, otherwise (7.51) and is illustrated in Figure 7.6.

By convention the (inverse) regularization parameter, denoted C, appears in front of the error term. As before, we can re-express the optimization problem by introducing slack variables.

Similarly, a nonzero value for \\x01an implies ϵ +\\x01ξn −yn + tn = 0, and such points must lie either on or below the lower boundary of the ϵ-tube. Furthermore, the two constraints ϵ+ξn +yn −tn = 0 and ϵ+\\x01ξn −yn +tn = 0 are incompatible, as is easily seen by adding them together and noting that ξn and \\x01ξn are nonnegative while ϵ is strictly positive, and so for every data point xn, either an or \\x01an (or both) must be zero.

As with the classiﬁcation case, there is an alternative formulation of the SVM for regression in which the parameter governing complexity has a more intuitive interpretation (Sch¨olkopf et al.,2000).

This has its origins with Valiant (1984) who formulated the probably approximately correct, or PAC, learning framework. The goal of the PAC framework is to understand how large a data set needs to be in order to give good generalization. It also gives bounds for the computational cost of learning, although we do not consider these here. Suppose that a data set D of size N is drawn from some joint distribution p(x, t) where x is the input variable and t represents the class label, and that we restrict attention to ‘noise free’ situations in which the class labels are determined by some (unknown) deterministic function t = g(x). In PAC learning we say that a function f(x; D), drawn from a space F of such functions on the basis of the training set D, has good generalization if its expected error rate is below some pre-speciﬁed threshold ϵ, so that Ex,t [I (f(x; D) ̸= t)] < ϵ (7.75) where I(·) is the indicator function, and the expectation is with respect to the dis- tribution p(x, t). The quantity on the left-hand side is a random variable, because it depends on the training set D, and the PAC framework requires that (7.75) holds, with probability greater than 1 −δ, for a data set D drawn randomly from p(x, t).',\n",

For a given choice of model space F, and for given parameters ϵ and δ, PAC learning aims to provide bounds on the minimum size N of data set needed to meet this criterion. A key quantity in PAC learning is the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension, or VC dimension, which provides a measure of the complexity of a space of functions, and which allows the PAC framework to be extended to spaces containing an inﬁnite number of functions. The bounds derived within the PAC framework are often described as worst-',\n",

In real-world applications of machine learning, we deal with distributions that have signiﬁcant reg- ularity, for example in which large regions of input space carry the same class label. As a consequence of the lack of any assumptions about the form of the distribution, the PAC bounds are very conservative, in other words they strongly over-estimate the size of data sets required to achieve a given generalization performance. For this reason, PAC bounds have found few, if any, practical applications. One attempt to improve the tightness of the PAC bounds is the PAC-Bayesian framework (McAllester, 2003), which considers a distribution over the space F of functions, somewhat analogous to the prior in a Bayesian treatment. This still con- siders any possible choice for p(x, t), and so although the bounds are tighter, they are still very conservative.7.2. Relevance Vector Machines Support vector machines have been used in a variety of classiﬁcation and regres- sion applications. Nevertheless, they suffer from a number of limitations, several of which have been highlighted already in this chapter. In particular, the outputs of an SVM represent decisions rather than posterior probabilities. Also, the SVM was originally formulated for two classes, and the extension to K > 2 classes is prob- lematic.',\n",

There is a complexity parameter C, or ν (as well as a parameter ϵ in the case of regression), that must be found using a hold-out method such as cross-validation. Finally, predictions are expressed as linear combinations of kernel functions that are centred on training data points and that are required to be positive deﬁnite. The relevance vector machine or RVM (Tipping, 2001) is a Bayesian sparse ker- nel technique for regression and classiﬁcation that shares many of the characteristics of the SVM whilst avoiding its principal limitations. Additionally, it typically leads to much sparser models resulting in correspondingly faster performance on test data whilst maintaining comparable generalization error. In contrast to the SVM we shall ﬁnd it more convenient to introduce the regres- sion form of the RVM ﬁrst and then consider the extension to classiﬁcation tasks.7.2.1 RVM for regression The relevance vector machine for regression is a linear model of the form studied in Chapter 3 but with a modiﬁed prior that results in sparse solutions.

The relevance vector machine is a speciﬁc instance of this model, which is in- tended to mirror the structure of the support vector machine. In particular, the basis functions are given by kernels, with one kernel associated with each of the data points from the training set. The general expression (7.77) then takes the SVM-like form y(x) = N \\x02 n=1 wnk(x, xn) + b (7.78) where b is a bias parameter. The number of parameters in this case is M = N + 1, and y(x) has the same form as the predictive model (7.64) for the SVM, except that the coefﬁcients an are here denoted wn. It should be emphasized that the subsequent analysis is valid for arbitrary choices of basis function, and for generality we shall work with the form (7.77). In contrast to the SVM, there is no restriction to positive- deﬁnite kernels, nor are the basis functions tied in either number or location to the training data points. Suppose we are given a set of N observations of the input vector x, which we denote collectively by a data matrix X whose nth row is xT n with n = 1, . . . ,N. The corresponding target values are given by t = (t1, . . . ,tN)T. Thus, the likelihood function is given by p(t|X, w, β) = N \\x0e n=1 p(tn|xn, w, β−1). (',\n",

Learning therefore proceeds by choosing initial values for α and β, evalu- ating the mean and covariance of the posterior using (7.82) and (7.83), respectively, and then alternately re-estimating the hyperparameters, using (7.87) and (7.88), and re-estimating the posterior mean and covariance, using (7.82) and (7.83), until a suit- able convergence criterion is satisﬁed. The second approach is to use the EM algorithm, and is discussed in Sec- tion 9.3.4. These two approaches to ﬁnding the values of the hyperparameters that maximize the evidence are formally equivalent. Numerically, however, it is found Exercise 9.23 that the direct optimization approach corresponding to (7.87) and (7.88) gives some- what faster convergence (Tipping, 2001). As a result of the optimization, we ﬁnd that a proportion of the hyperparameters {αi} are driven to large (in principle inﬁnite) values, and so the weight parameters Section 7.2.2 wi corresponding to these hyperparameters have posterior distributions with mean and variance both zero. Thus those parameters, and the corresponding basis func- tions φi(x), are removed from the model and play no role in making predictions for new inputs. In the case of models of the form (7.78), the inputs xn corresponding to the remaining nonzero weights are called relevance vectors, because they are iden- tiﬁed through the mechanism of automatic relevance determination, and are analo- gous to the support vectors of an SVM. It is worth emphasizing, however, that this mechanism for achieving sparsity in probabilistic models through automatic rele- vance determination is quite general and can be applied to any model expressed as an adaptive linear combination of basis functions. Having found values α⋆and β⋆for the hyperparameters that maximize the marginal likelihood, we can evaluate the predictive distribution over t for a new input x.

Recall that for localized basis functions, the predictive variance for linear regression models becomes small in regions of input space where there are no basis functions. In the case of an RVM with the basis functions centred on data points, the model will therefore become increasingly certain of its predictions when extrapolating outside the domain of the data (Rasmussen and Qui˜nonero-Candela, 2005), which of course is undesirable.

Remarkably, this greater sparsity is achieved with little or no reduction in generalization error compared with the corresponding SVM. The principal disadvantage of the RVM compared to the SVM is that training involves optimizing a nonconvex function, and training times can be longer than for a comparable SVM. For a model with M basis functions, the RVM requires inversion of a matrix of size M × M, which in general requires O(M 3) computation. In the speciﬁc case of the SVM-like model (7.78), we have M = N +1. As we have noted, there are techniques for training SVMs whose cost is roughly quadratic in N. Of course, in the case of the RVM we always have the option of starting with a smaller number of basis functions than N + 1. More signiﬁcantly, in the relevance vector machine the parameters governing complexity and noise variance are determined automatically from a single training run, whereas in the support vector machine the parameters C and ϵ (or ν) are generally found using cross-validation, which involves multiple training runs. Furthermore, in the next section we shall derive an alternative procedure for training the relevance vector machine that improves training speed signiﬁcantly.7.2.2 Analysis of sparsity We have noted earlier that the mechanism of automatic relevance determination causes a subset of parameters to be driven to zero.

In the process, we will arrive at a signiﬁcantly faster procedure for optimizing the hyper- parameters compared to the direct techniques given above. Before proceeding with a mathematical analysis, we ﬁrst give some informal insight into the origin of sparsity in Bayesian linear models. Consider a data set comprising N = 2 observations t1 and t2, together with a model having a single basis function φ(x), with hyperparameter α, along with isotropic noise having pre- cision β. From (7.85), the marginal likelihood is given by p(t|α, β) = N(t|0, C) in which the covariance matrix takes the form C = 1 β I + 1 αϕϕT (7.92) where ϕ denotes the N-dimensional vector (φ(x1), φ(x2))T, and similarly t = (t1, t2)T. Notice that this is just a zero-mean Gaussian process model over t with covariance C. Given a particular observation for t, our goal is to ﬁnd α⋆and β⋆by maximizing the marginal likelihood. We see from Figure 7.10 that, if there is a poor alignment between the direction of ϕ and that of the training data vector t, then the corresponding hyperparameter α will be driven to ∞, and the basis vector will be pruned from the model.',\n",

We now investigate the mechanism for sparsity from a more mathematical per- spective, for a general case involving M basis functions. To motivate this analysis we ﬁrst note that, in the result (7.87) for re-estimating the parameter αi, the terms on the right-hand side are themselves also functions of αi. These results therefore rep- resent implicit solutions, and iteration would be required even to determine a single αi with all other αj for j ̸= i ﬁxed. This suggests a different approach to solving the optimization problem for the RVM, in which we make explicit all of the dependence of the marginal likelihood (7.85) on a particular αi and then determine its stationary points explicitly (Faul and Tipping, 2002; Tipping and Faul, 2003).

The difference here is that in the RVM, this model uses the ARD prior (7.80) in which there is a separate precision hyperparameter associated with each weight parameter. In contrast to the regression model, we can no longer integrate analytically over the parameter vector w. Here we follow Tipping (2001) and use the Laplace ap- proximation, which was applied to the closely related problem of Bayesian logistic Section 4.4 regression in Section 4.5.1. We begin by initializing the hyperparameter vector α. For this given value of α, we then build a Gaussian approximation to the posterior distribution and thereby obtain an approximation to the marginal likelihood. Maximization of this approxi- mate marginal likelihood then leads to a re-estimated value for α, and the process is repeated until convergence. Let us consider the Laplace approximation for this model in more detail.

Figure 7.12 shows the relevance vector machine applied to a synthetic classiﬁ- cation data set. We see that the relevance vectors tend not to lie in the region of the Appendix A decision boundary, in contrast to the support vector machine. This is consistent with our earlier discussion of sparsity in the RVM, because a basis function φi(x) centred on a data point near the boundary will have a vector ϕi that is poorly aligned with the training data vector t. One of the potential advantages of the relevance vector machine compared with the SVM is that it makes probabilistic predictions. For example, this allows the RVM to be used to help construct an emission density in a nonlinear extension of the linear dynamical system for tracking faces in video sequences (Williams et al.,2005).',\n",

Again, the Laplace approximation can be used to optimize the hyperparameters (Tipping, 2001), in which the model and its Hessian are found using IRLS. This gives a more principled approach to multiclass classiﬁcation than the pairwise method used in the support vector machine and also provides probabilis- tic predictions for new data points. The principal disadvantage is that the Hessian matrix has size MK ×MK, where M is the number of active basis functions, which gives an additional factor of K3 in the computational cost of training compared with the two-class RVM.

We have seen in Chapter 1 that probability theory can be expressed in terms of two simple equations corresponding to the sum rule and the product rule. All of the probabilistic infer- ence and learning manipulations discussed in this book, no matter how complex, amount to repeated application of these two equations. We could therefore proceed to formulate and solve complicated probabilistic models purely by algebraic ma- nipulation. However, we shall ﬁnd it highly advantageous to augment the analysis using diagrammatic representations of probability distributions, called probabilistic graphical models. These offer several useful properties: 1. They provide a simple way to visualize the structure of a probabilistic model and can be used to design and motivate new models.2. Insights into the properties of the model, including conditional independence properties, can be obtained by inspection of the graph.359',\n",

Complex computations, required to perform inference and learning in sophis- ticated models, can be expressed in terms of graphical manipulations, in which underlying mathematical expressions are carried along implicitly. A graph comprises nodes (also called vertices) connected by links (also known as edges or arcs). In a probabilistic graphical model, each node represents a random variable (or group of random variables), and the links express probabilistic relation- ships between these variables. The graph then captures the way in which the joint distribution over all of the random variables can be decomposed into a product of factors each depending only on a subset of the variables. We shall begin by dis- cussing Bayesian networks, also known as directed graphical models, in which the links of the graphs have a particular directionality indicated by arrows. The other major class of graphical models are Markov random ﬁelds, also known as undirected graphical models, in which the links do not carry arrows and have no directional signiﬁcance. Directed graphs are useful for expressing causal relationships between random variables, whereas undirected graphs are better suited to expressing soft con- straints between random variables. For the purposes of solving inference problems, it is often convenient to convert both directed and undirected graphs into a different representation called a factor graph. In this chapter, we shall focus on the key aspects of graphical models as needed for applications in pattern recognition and machine learning.',\n",

Bayesian Networks In order to motivate the use of directed graphs to describe probability distributions, consider ﬁrst an arbitrary joint distribution p(a, b, c) over three variables a, b, and c. Note that at this stage, we do not need to specify anything further about these vari- ables, such as whether they are discrete or continuous. Indeed, one of the powerful aspects of graphical models is that a speciﬁc graph can make probabilistic statements for a broad class of distributions. By application of the product rule of probability (1.11), we can write the joint distribution in the form p(a, b, c) = p(c|a, b)p(a, b). (8.1) A second application of the product rule, this time to the second term on the right- hand side of (8.1), gives p(a, b, c) = p(c|a, b)p(b|a)p(a). (8.2) Note that this decomposition holds for any choice of the joint distribution. We now represent the right-hand side of (8.2) in terms of a simple graphical model as follows.',\n",

Then, for each conditional distribution we add directed links (arrows) to the graph from the nodes corresponding to the variables on which the distribution is conditioned. Thus for the factor p(c|a, b), there will be links from nodes a and b to node c, whereas for the factor p(a) there will be no incoming links. The result is the graph shown in Figure 8.1. If there is a link going from a node a to a node b, then we say that node a is the parent of node b, and we say that node b is the child of node a. Note that we shall not make any formal distinction between a node and the variable to which it corresponds but will simply use the same symbol to refer to both. An interesting point to note about (8.2) is that the left-hand side is symmetrical with respect to the three variables a, b, and c, whereas the right-hand side is not. Indeed, in making the decomposition in (8.2), we have implicitly chosen a particular ordering, namely a, b, c, and had we chosen a different ordering we would have obtained a different decomposition and hence a different graphical representation. We shall return to this point later. For the moment let us extend the example of Figure 8.1 by considering the joint distribution over K variables given by p(x1, . . . ,',\n",

So far, we have worked with completely general joint distributions, so that the decompositions, and their representations as fully connected graphs, will be applica- ble to any choice of distribution.

Exercise 8.1 The directed graphs that we are considering are subject to an important restric- tion namely that there must be no directed cycles, in other words there are no closed paths within the graph such that we can move from node to node along links follow- ing the direction of the arrows and end up back at the starting node.

Although we shall devote the whole of Chapter 11 to a detailed discussion of sampling methods, it is instructive to outline here one technique, called ancestral sampling, which is particularly relevant to graphical models. Consider a joint distribution p(x1, . . . ,xK) over K variables that factorizes according to (8.5) corresponding to a directed acyclic graph. We shall suppose that the variables have been ordered such that there are no links from any node to any lower numbered node, in other words each node has a higher number than any of its parents.

Note that at each stage, these parent values will always be available because they correspond to lower- numbered nodes that have already been sampled. Techniques for sampling from speciﬁc distributions will be discussed in detail in Chapter 11. Once we have sam- pled from the ﬁnal variable xK, we will have achieved our objective of obtaining a sample from the joint distribution. To obtain a sample from some marginal distribu- tion corresponding to a subset of the variables, we simply take the sampled values for the required nodes and ignore the sampled values for the remaining nodes.

GRAPHICAL MODELS Figure 8.8 A graphical model representing the process by which images of objects are created, in which the identity of an object (a discrete variable) and the position and orientation of that object (continuous variables) have independent prior probabilities. The image (a vector of pixel intensities) has a probability distribution that is dependent on the identity of the object as well as on its position and orientation. Image Object Orientation Position For practical applications of probabilistic models, it will typically be the higher- numbered variables corresponding to terminal nodes of the graph that represent the observations, with lower-numbered nodes corresponding to latent variables. The primary role of the latent variables is to allow a complicated distribution over the observed variables to be represented in terms of a model constructed from simpler (typically exponential family) conditional distributions. We can interpret such models as expressing the processes by which the observed data arose. For instance, consider an object recognition task in which each observed data point corresponds to an image (comprising a vector of pixel intensities) of one of the objects. In this case, the latent variables might have an interpretation as the position and orientation of the object. Given a particular observed image, our goal is to ﬁnd the posterior distribution over objects, in which we integrate over all possible positions and orientations. We can represent this problem using a graphical model of the form show in Figure 8.8. The graphical model captures the causal process (Pearl, 1988) by which the ob- served data was generated.',\n",

By contrast, the polynomial regression model described by Figure 8.5 is not generative because there is no probability distribution associated with the input variable x, and so it is not possible to generate synthetic data points from this model. We could make it generative by introducing a suitable prior distribution p(x), at the expense of a more complex model. The hidden variables in a probabilistic model need not, however, have any ex- plicit physical interpretation but may be introduced simply to allow a more complex joint distribution to be constructed from simpler components. In either case, the technique of ancestral sampling applied to a generative model mimics the creation of the observed data and would therefore give rise to ‘fantasy’ data whose probability distribution (if the model were a perfect representation of reality) would be the same as that of the observed data. In practice, producing synthetic observations from a generative model can prove informative in understanding the form of the probability distribution represented by that model.8.1.3 Discrete variables We have discussed the importance of probability distributions that are members of the exponential family, and we have seen that this family includes many well- Section 2.4 known distributions as particular cases.

Such models have particularly nice properties if we choose the relationship be- tween each parent-child pair in a directed graph to be conjugate, and we shall ex- plore several examples of this shortly. Two cases are particularly worthy of note, namely when the parent and child node each correspond to discrete variables and when they each correspond to Gaussian variables, because in these two cases the relationship can be extended hierarchically to construct arbitrarily complex directed acyclic graphs. We begin by examining the discrete case. The probability distribution p(x|µ) for a single discrete variable x having K possible states (using the 1-of-K representation) is given by p(x|µ) = K \\x0e k=1 µxk k (8.9) and is governed by the parameters µ = (µ1, . . . ,µK)T. Due to the constraint \\x05 k µk = 1, only K −1 values for µk need to be speciﬁed in order to deﬁne the distribution. Now suppose that we have two discrete variables, x1 and x2, each of which has K states, and we wish to model their joint distribution. We denote the probability of observing both x1k = 1 and x2l = 1 by the parameter µkl, where x1k denotes the kth component of x1, and similarly for x2l.',\n",

It is easily seen that the total number of parameters that must be speciﬁed for an arbitrary joint distribution over M variables is KM −1 and therefore grows exponentially with the number M of variables. Using the product rule, we can factor the joint distribution p(x1, x2) in the form p(x2|x1)p(x1), which corresponds to a two-node graph with a link going from the x1 node to the x2 node as shown in Figure 8.9(a).

GRAPHICAL MODELS Figure 8.10 This chain of M discrete nodes, each having K states, requires the speciﬁcation of K −1 + (M −1)K(K −1) parameters, which grows linearly with the length M of the chain. In contrast, a fully con- nected graph of M nodes would have KM −1 param- eters, which grows exponentially with M. x1 x2 xM a separate multinomial distribution, and the total number of parameters would be 2(K −1). For a distribution over M independent discrete variables, each having K states, the total number of parameters would be M(K −1), which therefore grows linearly with the number of variables. From a graphical perspective, we have reduced the number of parameters by dropping links in the graph, at the expense of having a restricted class of distributions. More generally, if we have M discrete variables x1, . . . ,xM, we can model the joint distribution using a directed graph with one variable corresponding to each node. The conditional distribution at each node is given by a set of nonnegative pa- rameters subject to the usual normalization constraint. If the graph is fully connected then we have a completely general distribution having KM −1 parameters, whereas if there are no links in the graph the joint distribution factorizes into the product of the marginals, and the total number of parameters is M(K −1). Graphs having in- termediate levels of connectivity allow for more general distributions than the fully factorized one while requiring fewer parameters than the general joint distribution.

This gives a total parameter count of K −1+(M −1)K(K −1), which is quadratic in K and which grows linearly (rather than exponentially) with the length M of the chain. An alternative way to reduce the number of independent parameters in a model is by sharing parameters (also known as tying of parameters). For instance, in the chain example of Figure 8.10, we can arrange that all of the conditional distributions p(xi|xi−1), for i = 2, . . . ,M, are governed by the same set of K(K−1) parameters. Together with the K−1 parameters governing the distribution of x1, this gives a total of K2 −1 parameters that must be speciﬁed in order to deﬁne the joint distribution. We can turn a graph over discrete variables into a Bayesian model by introduc- ing Dirichlet priors for the parameters.

GRAPHICAL MODELS 8.1.4 Linear-Gaussian models In the previous section, we saw how to construct joint probability distributions over a set of discrete variables by expressing the variables as nodes in a directed acyclic graph. Here we show how a multivariate Gaussian can be expressed as a directed graph corresponding to a linear-Gaussian model over the component vari- ables. This allows us to impose interesting structure on the distribution, with the general Gaussian and the diagonal covariance Gaussian representing opposite ex- tremes. Several widely used techniques are examples of linear-Gaussian models, such as probabilistic principal component analysis, factor analysis, and linear dy- namical systems (Roweis and Ghahramani, 1999). We shall make extensive use of the results of this section in later chapters when we consider some of these techniques in detail. Consider an arbitrary directed acyclic graph over D variables in which node i represents a single continuous random variable xi having a Gaussian distribution. The mean of this distribution is taken to be a linear combination of the states of its parent nodes pai of node i p(xi|pai) = N ⎛ ⎝xi \\x07\\x07\\x07\\x07\\x07\\x07 \\x02 j∈pai wijxj + bi, vi ⎞ ⎠ (8.11) where wij and bi are parameters governing the mean, and vi is the variance of the conditional distribution for xi. The log of the joint distribution is then the log of the product of these conditionals over all nodes in the graph and hence takes the form ln p(x) = D \\x02 i=1 ln p(xi|pai) (8.12) = − D \\x02 i=1 1 2vi ⎛ ⎝xi − \\x02 j∈pai wijxj −bi ⎞ ⎠ 2 + const (8.13) where x = (x1, . . . ,xD)T and ‘const’ denotes terms independent of x. We see that this is a quadratic function of the components of x, and hence the joint distribution p(x) is a multivariate Gaussian. We can determine the mean and covariance of the joint distribution recursively as follows.',\n",

Now consider a fully connected graph in which each node has all lower num- bered nodes as parents. The matrix wij then has i −1 entries on the ith row and hence is a lower triangular matrix (with no entries on the leading diagonal). Then the total number of parameters wij is obtained by taking the number D2 of elements in a D ×D matrix, subtracting D to account for the absence of elements on the lead- ing diagonal, and then dividing by 2 because the matrix has elements only below the diagonal, giving a total of D(D−1)/2. The total number of independent parameters {wij} and {vi} in the covariance matrix is therefore D(D + 1)/2 corresponding to a general symmetric covariance matrix.

In this case, we can write the conditional distribution for node i in the form p(xi|pai) = N ⎛ ⎝xi \\x07\\x07\\x07\\x07\\x07\\x07 \\x02 j∈pai Wijxj + bi, Σi ⎞ ⎠ (8.19) where now Wij is a matrix (which is nonsquare if xi and xj have different dimen- sionalities). Again it is easy to verify that the joint distribution over all variables is Gaussian. Note that we have already encountered a speciﬁc example of the linear-Gaussian relationship when we saw that the conjugate prior for the mean µ of a Gaussian Section 2.3.6 variable x is itself a Gaussian distribution over µ. The joint distribution over x and µ is therefore Gaussian. This corresponds to a simple two-node graph in which the node representing µ is the parent of the node representing x. The mean of the distribution over µ is a parameter controlling a prior, and so it can be viewed as a hyperparameter. Because the value of this hyperparameter may itself be unknown, we can again treat it from a Bayesian perspective by introducing a prior over the hyperparameter, sometimes called a hyperprior, which is again given by a Gaussian distribution. This type of construction can be extended in principle to any level and is an illustration of a hierarchical Bayesian model, of which we shall encounter further examples in later chapters.8.2. Conditional Independence An important concept for probability distributions over multiple variables is that of conditional independence (Dawid, 1980). Consider three variables a, b, and c, and suppose that the conditional distribution of a, given b and c, is such that it does not depend on the value of b, so that p(a|b, c) = p(a|c). (',\n",

We shall see examples of this shortly. If we are given an expression for the joint distribution over a set of variables in terms of a product of conditional distributions (i.e., the mathematical representation underlying a directed graph), then we could in principle test whether any poten- tial conditional independence property holds by repeated application of the sum and product rules of probability. In practice, such an approach would be very time con- suming. An important and elegant feature of graphical models is that conditional independence properties of the joint distribution can be read directly from the graph without having to perform any analytical manipulations. The general framework for achieving this is called d-separation, where the ‘d’ stands for ‘directed’ (Pearl, 1988). Here we shall motivate the concept of d-separation and give a general state- ment of the d-separation criterion.',\n",

Together, these will motivate and illustrate the key concepts of d-separation. The ﬁrst of the three examples is shown in Figure 8.15, and the joint distribution corresponding to this graph is easily written down using the general result (8.5) to give p(a, b, c) = p(a|c)p(b|c)p(c). (8.23) If none of the variables are observed, then we can investigate whether a and b are independent by marginalizing both sides of (8.23) with respect to c to give p(a, b) = \\x02 c p(a|c)p(b|c)p(c).

GRAPHICAL MODELS Figure 8.16 As in Figure 8.15 but where we have conditioned on the value of variable c. c a b where ∅denotes the empty set, and the symbol ̸⊥⊥means that the conditional inde- pendence property does not hold in general. Of course, it may hold for a particular distribution by virtue of the speciﬁc numerical values associated with the various conditional probabilities, but it does not follow in general from the structure of the graph. Now suppose we condition on the variable c, as represented by the graph of Figure 8.16. From (8.23), we can easily write down the conditional distribution of a and b, given c, in the form p(a, b|c) = p(a, b, c) p(c) = p(a|c)p(b|c) and so we obtain the conditional independence property a ⊥⊥b | c. We can provide a simple graphical interpretation of this result by considering the path from node a to node b via c. The node c is said to be tail-to-tail with re- spect to this path because the node is connected to the tails of the two arrows, and the presence of such a path connecting nodes a and b causes these nodes to be de- pendent. However, when we condition on node c, as in Figure 8.16, the conditioned node ‘blocks’ the path from a to b and causes a and b to become (conditionally) independent. We can similarly consider the graph shown in Figure 8.17. The joint distribution corresponding to this graph is again obtained from our general formula (8.5) to give p(a, b, c) = p(a)p(c|a)p(b|c). (8.26) First of all, suppose that none of the variables are observed. Again, we can test to see if a and b are independent by marginalizing over c to give p(a, b) = p(a) \\x02 c p(c|a)p(b|c) = p(a)p(b|a).

Now suppose we condition on node c, as shown in Figure 8.18. Using Bayes’ theorem, together with (8.26), we obtain p(a, b|c) = p(a, b, c) p(c) = p(a)p(c|a)p(b|c) p(c) = p(a|c)p(b|c) and so again we obtain the conditional independence property a ⊥⊥b | c. As before, we can interpret these results graphically. The node c is said to be head-to-tail with respect to the path from node a to node b. Such a path connects nodes a and b and renders them dependent. If we now observe c, as in Figure 8.18, then this observation ‘blocks’ the path from a to b and so we obtain the conditional independence property a ⊥⊥b | c. Finally, we consider the third of our 3-node examples, shown by the graph in Figure 8.19. As we shall see, this has a more subtle behaviour than the two previous graphs. The joint distribution can again be written down using our general result (8.5) to give p(a, b, c) = p(a)p(b)p(c|a, b). (8.28) Consider ﬁrst the case where none of the variables are observed.

In this graph, the act of conditioning induces a depen- dence between a and b. c a b and so a and b are independent with no variables observed, in contrast to the two previous examples. We can write this result as a ⊥⊥b | ∅. (8.29) Now suppose we condition on c, as indicated in Figure 8.20. The conditional distri- bution of a and b is then given by p(a, b|c) = p(a, b, c) p(c) = p(a)p(b)p(c|a, b) p(c) which in general does not factorize into the product p(a)p(b), and so a ̸⊥⊥b | c. Thus our third example has the opposite behaviour from the ﬁrst two. Graphically, we say that node c is head-to-head with respect to the path from a to b because it connects to the heads of the two arrows. When node c is unobserved, it ‘blocks’ the path, and the variables a and b are independent. However, conditioning on c ‘unblocks’ the path and renders a and b dependent. There is one more subtlety associated with this third example that we need to consider. First we introduce some more terminology. We say that node y is a de- scendant of node x if there is a path from x to y in which each step of the path follows the directions of the arrows. Then it can be shown that a head-to-head path will become unblocked if either the node, or any of its descendants, is observed.',\n",

By contrast, a head-to-head node blocks a path if it is unobserved, but once the node, and/or at least one of its descendants, is observed the path becomes unblocked. It is worth spending a moment to understand further the unusual behaviour of the graph of Figure 8.20. Consider a particular instance of such a graph corresponding to a problem with three binary random variables relating to the fuel system on a car, as shown in Figure 8.21. The variables are called B, representing the state of a battery that is either charged (B = 1) or ﬂat (B = 0), F representing the state of the fuel tank that is either full of fuel (F = 1) or empty (F = 0), and G, which is the state of an electric fuel gauge and which indicates either full (G = 1) or empty',\n",

The battery is either charged or ﬂat, and independently the fuel tank is either full or empty, with prior probabilities p(B = 1) = 0.9 p(F = 1) = 0.9.

Thus observing that the gauge reads empty makes it more likely that the tank is indeed empty, as we would intuitively expect. Next suppose that we also check the state of the battery and ﬁnd that it is ﬂat, i.e., B = 0. We have now observed the states of both the fuel gauge and the battery, as shown by the right-hand graph in Figure 8.21. The posterior probability that the fuel tank is empty given the observations of both the fuel gauge and the battery state is then given by p(F = 0|G = 0, B = 0) = p(G = 0|B = 0, F = 0)p(F = 0) \\x05 F ∈{0,1} p(G = 0|B = 0, F)p(F) ≃0.111 (8.33) where the prior probability p(B = 0) has cancelled between numerator and denom- inator. Thus the probability that the tank is empty has decreased (from 0.257 to 0.111) as a result of the observation of the state of the battery. This accords with our intuition that ﬁnding out that the battery is ﬂat explains away the observation that the fuel gauge reads empty. We see that the state of the fuel tank and that of the battery have indeed become dependent on each other as a result of observing the reading on the fuel gauge. In fact, this would also be the case if, instead of observing the fuel gauge directly, we observed the state of some descendant of G. Note that the probability p(F = 0|G = 0, B = 0) ≃0.111 is greater than the prior probability p(F = 0) = 0.1 because the observation that the fuel gauge reads zero still provides some evidence in favour of an empty fuel tank.8.2.2 D-separation We now give a general statement of the d-separation property (Pearl, 1988) for directed graphs.',\n",

Consider a general directed graph in which A, B, and C are arbi- trary nonintersecting sets of nodes (whose union may be smaller than the complete set of nodes in the graph). We wish to ascertain whether a particular conditional independence statement A ⊥⊥B | C is implied by a given directed acyclic graph. To do so, we consider all possible paths from any node in A to any node in B. Any such path is said to be blocked if it includes a node such that either (a) the arrows on the path meet either head-to-tail or tail-to-tail at the node, and the node is in the set C, or (b) the arrows meet head-to-head at the node, and neither the node, nor any of its descendants, is in the set C. If all paths are blocked, then A is said to be d-separated from B by C, and the joint distribution over all of the variables in the graph will satisfy A ⊥⊥B | C. The concept of d-separation is illustrated in Figure 8.22. In graph (a), the path from a to b is not blocked by node f because it is a tail-to-tail node for this path and is not observed, nor is it blocked by node e because, although the latter is a head-to-head node, it has a descendant c because is in the conditioning set.

Section 3.3 A related graphical structure arises in an approach to classiﬁcation called the naive Bayes model, in which we use conditional independence assumptions to sim- plify the model structure. Suppose our observed variable consists of a D-dimensional vector x = (x1, . . . ,xD)T, and we wish to assign observed values of x to one of K classes. Using the 1-of-K encoding scheme, we can represent these classes by a K- dimensional binary vector z. We can then deﬁne a generative model by introducing a multinomial prior p(z|µ) over the class labels, where the kth component µk of µ is the prior probability of class Ck, together with a conditional distribution p(x|z) for the observed vector x. The key assumption of the naive Bayes model is that, conditioned on the class z, the distributions of the input variables x1, . . . ,xD are in- dependent. The graphical representation of this model is shown in Figure 8.24. We see that observation of z blocks the path between xi and xj for j ̸= i (because such paths are tail-to-tail at the node z) and so xi and xj are conditionally independent given z. If, however, we marginalize out z (so that z is unobserved) the tail-to-tail path from xi to xj is no longer blocked. This tells us that in general the marginal density p(x) will not factorize with respect to the components of x.

The solution is obtained by ﬁtting the model for each class separately using the correspondingly labelled data. As an example, suppose that the probability density within each class is chosen to be Gaussian. In this case, the naive Bayes assumption then implies that the covariance matrix for each Gaussian is diagonal, and the contours of constant density within each class will be axis-aligned ellipsoids. The marginal density, however, is given by a superposition of diagonal Gaussians (with weighting coefﬁcients given by the class priors) and so will no longer factorize with respect to its components. The naive Bayes assumption is helpful when the dimensionality D of the input space is high, making density estimation in the full D-dimensional space more chal- lenging. It is also useful if the input vector contains both discrete and continuous variables, since each can be represented separately using appropriate models (e.g., Bernoulli distributions for binary observations or Gaussians for real-valued vari- ables). The conditional independence assumption of this model is clearly a strong one that may lead to rather poor representations of the class-conditional densities. Nevertheless, even if this assumption is not precisely satisﬁed, the model may still give good classiﬁcation performance in practice because the decision boundaries can be insensitive to some of the details in the class-conditional densities, as illustrated in Figure 1.27.

The graph also expresses a set of conditional independence statements obtained through the d-separation criterion, and the d-separation theorem is really an expression of the equivalence of these two properties. In order to make this clear, it is helpful to think of a directed graph as a ﬁlter. Suppose we consider a particular joint probability distribution p(x) over the variables x corresponding to the (nonobserved) nodes of the graph. The ﬁlter will allow this distribution to pass through if, and only if, it can be expressed in terms of the factorization (8.5) implied by the graph. If we present to the ﬁlter the set of all possible distributions p(x) over the set of variables x, then the subset of distributions that are passed by the ﬁlter will be denoted DF, for directed factorization. This is illustrated in Figure 8.25. Alternatively, we can use the graph as a different kind of ﬁlter by ﬁrst listing all of the conditional independence properties obtained by applying the d-separation criterion to the graph, and then allowing a distribution to pass only if it satisﬁes all of these properties. If we present all possible distributions p(x) to this second kind of ﬁlter, then the d-separation theorem tells us that the set of distributions that will be allowed through is precisely the set DF.

GRAPHICAL MODELS p(x) DF Figure 8.25 We can view a graphical model (in this case a directed graph) as a ﬁlter in which a prob- ability distribution p(x) is allowed through the ﬁlter if, and only if, it satisﬁes the directed factorization property (8.5). The set of all possible probability distributions p(x) that pass through the ﬁlter is denoted DF. We can alternatively use the graph to ﬁlter distributions according to whether they respect all of the conditional independencies implied by the d-separation properties of the graph. The d-separation theorem says that it is the same set of distributions DF that will be allowed through this second kind of ﬁlter.tions p(x). At the other extreme, we have the fully disconnected graph, i.e., one having no links at all. This corresponds to joint distributions which factorize into the product of the marginal distributions over the variables comprising the nodes of the graph. Note that for any given graph, the set of distributions DF will include any dis- tributions that have additional independence properties beyond those described by the graph. For instance, a fully factorized distribution will always be passed through the ﬁlter implied by any graph over the corresponding set of variables.

A Markov random ﬁeld, also known as a Markov network or an undirected graphical model (Kindermann and Snell, 1980), has a set of nodes each of which corresponds to a variable or group of variables, as well as a set of links each of which connects a pair of nodes. The links are undirected, that is they do not carry arrows. In the case of undirected graphs, it is convenient to begin with a discussion of conditional independence properties.8.3.1 Conditional independence properties In the case of directed graphs, we saw that it was possible to test whether a par- Section 8.2 ticular conditional independence property holds by applying a graphical test called d-separation. This involved testing whether or not the paths connecting two sets of nodes were ‘blocked’. The deﬁnition of blocked, however, was somewhat subtle due to the presence of paths having head-to-head nodes. We might ask whether it is possible to deﬁne an alternative graphical semantics for probability distributions such that conditional independence is determined by simple graph separation.

GRAPHICAL MODELS Figure 8.27 An example of an undirected graph in which every path from any node in set A to any node in set B passes through at least one node in set C. Conse- quently the conditional independence property A ⊥⊥B | C holds for any probability distribution described by this graph. A C B directionality from the links of the graph, the asymmetry between parent and child nodes is removed, and so the subtleties associated with head-to-head nodes no longer arise. Suppose that in an undirected graph we identify three sets of nodes, denoted A, B, and C, and that we consider the conditional independence property A ⊥⊥B | C. (8.37) To test whether this property is satisﬁed by a probability distribution deﬁned by a graph we consider all possible paths that connect nodes in set A to nodes in set B. If all such paths pass through one or more nodes in set C, then all such paths are ‘blocked’ and so the conditional independence property holds. However, if there is at least one such path that is not blocked, then the property does not necessarily hold, or more precisely there will exist at least some distributions corresponding to the graph that do not satisfy this conditional independence relation. This is illustrated with an example in Figure 8.27. Note that this is exactly the same as the d-separation crite- rion except that there is no ‘explaining away’ phenomenon. Testing for conditional independence in undirected graphs is therefore simpler than in directed graphs. An alternative way to view the conditional independence test is to imagine re- moving all nodes in set C from the graph together with any links that connect to those nodes. We then ask if there exists a path that connects any node in A to any node in B. If there are no such paths, then the conditional independence property must hold. The Markov blanket for an undirected graph takes a particularly simple form, because a node will be conditionally independent of all other nodes conditioned only on the neighbouring nodes, as illustrated in Figure 8.28.',\n",

It has the property that the conditional distribution of xi, conditioned on all the remaining variables in the graph, is dependent only on the variables in the Markov blanket. If we consider two nodes xi and xj that are not connected by a link, then these variables must be conditionally independent given all other nodes in the graph. This follows from the fact that there is no direct path between the two nodes, and all other paths pass through nodes that are observed, and hence those paths are blocked. This conditional independence property can be expressed as p(xi, xj|x\\\\{i,j}) = p(xi|x\\\\{i,j})p(xj|x\\\\{i,j}) (8.38) where x\\\\{i,j} denotes the set x of all variables with xi and xj removed. The factor- ization of the joint distribution must therefore be such that xi and xj do not appear in the same factor in order for the conditional independence property to hold for all possible distributions belonging to the graph. This leads us to consider a graphical concept called a clique, which is deﬁned as a subset of the nodes in a graph such that there exists a link between all pairs of nodes in the subset. In other words, the set of nodes in a clique is fully connected. Furthermore, a maximal clique is a clique such that it is not possible to include any other nodes from the graph in the set without it ceasing to be a clique.

The set {x1, x2, x3, x4} is not a clique because of the missing link from x1 to x4. We can therefore deﬁne the factors in the decomposition of the joint distribution to be functions of the variables in the cliques. In fact, we can consider functions of the maximal cliques, without loss of generality, because other cliques must be subsets of maximal cliques. Thus, if {x1, x2, x3} is a maximal clique and we deﬁne an arbitrary function over this clique, then including another factor deﬁned over a subset of these variables would be redundant.

By considering only potential functions which satisfy ψC(xC) ⩾0 we ensure that p(x) ⩾0. In (8.40) we have assumed that x comprises discrete variables, but the framework is equally applicable to continuous variables, or a combination of the two, in which the summation is replaced by the appropriate combination of summation and integration. Note that we do not restrict the choice of potential functions to those that have a speciﬁc probabilistic interpretation as marginal or conditional distributions. This is in contrast to directed graphs in which each factor represents the conditional distribu- tion of the corresponding variable, conditioned on the state of its parents. However, in special cases, for instance where the undirected graph is constructed by starting with a directed graph, the potential functions may indeed have such an interpretation, as we shall see shortly. One consequence of the generality of the potential functions ψC(xC) is that their product will in general not be correctly normalized. We therefore have to in- troduce an explicit normalization factor given by (8.40).

The presence of this normalization constant is one of the major limitations of undirected graphs. If we have a model with M discrete nodes each having K states, then the evaluation of the normalization term involves summing over KM states and so (in the worst case) is exponential in the size of the model. The partition function is needed for parameter learning because it will be a function of any parameters that govern the potential functions ψC(xC). However, for evaluation of local conditional distributions, the partition function is not needed because a conditional is the ratio of two marginals, and the partition function cancels between numerator and denom- inator when evaluating this ratio. Similarly, for evaluating local marginal probabil- ities we can work with the unnormalized joint distribution and then normalize the marginals explicitly at the end. Provided the marginals only involves a small number of variables, the evaluation of their normalization coefﬁcient will be feasible. So far, we have discussed the notion of conditional independence based on sim- ple graph separation and we have proposed a factorization of the joint distribution that is intended to correspond to this conditional independence structure.

To do this we again return to the concept of a graphical model as a ﬁlter, corre- sponding to Figure 8.25. Consider the set of all possible distributions deﬁned over a ﬁxed set of variables corresponding to the nodes of a particular undirected graph. We can deﬁne UI to be the set of such distributions that are consistent with the set of conditional independence statements that can be read from the graph using graph separation. Similarly, we can deﬁne UF to be the set of such distributions that can be expressed as a factorization of the form (8.39) with respect to the maximal cliques of the graph. The Hammersley-Clifford theorem (Clifford, 1990) states that the sets UI and UF are identical. Because we are restricted to potential functions which are strictly positive it is convenient to express them as exponentials, so that ψC(xC) = exp {−E(xC)} (8.41) where E(xC) is called an energy function, and the exponential representation is called the Boltzmann distribution. The joint distribution is deﬁned as the product of potentials, and so the total energy is obtained by adding the energies of each of the maximal cliques.

Let the observed noisy image be described by an array of binary pixel values yi ∈ {−1, +1}, where the index i = 1, . . . ,D runs over all pixels. We shall suppose that the image is obtained by taking an unknown noise-free image, described by binary pixel values xi ∈{−1, +1} and randomly ﬂipping the sign of pixels with some small probability.

The idea is ﬁrst to initialize the variables {xi}, which we do by simply setting xi = yi for all i.

Note that in this case, the partition function Z = 1. Let us consider how to generalize this construction, so that we can convert any distribution speciﬁed by a factorization over a directed graph into one speciﬁed by a factorization over an undirected graph. This can be achieved if the clique potentials of the undirected graph are given by the conditional distributions of the directed graph. In order for this to be valid, we must ensure that the set of variables that appears in each of the conditional distributions is a member of at least one clique of the undirected graph. For nodes on the directed graph having just one parent, this is achieved simply by replacing the directed link with an undirected link. However, for nodes in the directed graph having more than one parent, this is not sufﬁcient. These are nodes that have ‘head-to-head’ paths encountered in our discussion of conditional independence.

To ensure this, we add extra links between all pairs of parents of the node x4. Anachronistically, this process of ‘marrying the parents’ has become known as moralization, and the resulting undirected graph, after dropping the arrows, is called the moral graph. It is important to observe that the moral graph in this example is fully connected and so exhibits no conditional independence properties, in contrast to the original directed graph. Thus in general to convert a directed graph into an undirected graph, we ﬁrst add additional undirected links between all pairs of parents for each node in the graph and',\n",

There will always exist at least one maximal clique that contains all of the variables in the factor as a result of the moralization step.

The process of converting a directed graph into an undirected graph plays an important role in exact inference techniques such as the junction tree algorithm. Section 8.4 Converting from an undirected to a directed representation is much less common and in general presents problems due to the normalization constraints. We saw that in going from a directed to an undirected representation we had to discard some conditional independence properties from the graph. Of course, we could always trivially convert any distribution over a directed graph into one over an undirected graph by simply using a fully connected undirected graph.

The process of moralization adds the fewest extra links and so retains the maximum number of independence properties. We have seen that the procedure for determining the conditional independence properties is different between directed and undirected graphs. It turns out that the two types of graph can express different conditional independence properties, and it is worth exploring this issue in more detail. To do so, we return to the view of a speciﬁc (directed or undirected) graph as a ﬁlter, so that the set of all possible Section 8.2 distributions over the given variables could be reduced to a subset that respects the conditional independencies implied by the graph. A graph is said to be a D map (for ‘dependency map’) of a distribution if every conditional independence statement satisﬁed by the distribution is reﬂected in the graph. Thus a completely disconnected graph (no links) will be a trivial D map for any distribution. Alternatively, we can consider a speciﬁc distribution and ask which graphs have the appropriate conditional independence properties. If every conditional indepen- dence statement implied by a graph is satisﬁed by a speciﬁc distribution, then the graph is said to be an I map (for ‘independence map’) of that distribution. Clearly a fully connected graph will be a trivial I map for any distribution.

Speciﬁcally, we shall see that many algorithms can be expressed in terms of the propagation of local messages around the graph. In this section, we shall focus primarily on techniques for exact inference, and in Chapter 10 we shall consider a number of approximate inference algorithms. To start with, let us consider the graphical interpretation of Bayes’ theorem. Suppose we decompose the joint distribution p(x, y) over two variables x and y into a product of factors in the form p(x, y) = p(x)p(y|x). This can be represented by the directed graph shown in Figure 8.37(a). Now suppose we observe the value of y, as indicated by the shaded node in Figure 8.37(b). We can view the marginal distribution p(x) as a prior over the latent variable x, and our goal is to infer the corresponding posterior distribution over x. Using the sum and product rules of probability we can evaluate p(y) = \\x02 x′ p(y|x′)p(x′) (8.47) which can then be used in Bayes’ theorem to calculate p(x|y) = p(y|x)p(x) p(y) . (',\n",

(8.48) Thus the joint distribution is now expressed in terms of p(y) and p(x|y). From a graphical perspective, the joint distribution p(x, y) is now represented by the graph shown in Figure 8.37(c), in which the direction of the arrow is reversed. This is the simplest example of an inference problem for a graphical model.8.4.1 Inference on a chain Now consider a more complex problem involving the chain of nodes of the form shown in Figure 8.32. This example will lay the foundation for a discussion of exact inference in more general graphs later in this section. Speciﬁcally, we shall consider the undirected graph in Figure 8.32(b). We have already seen that the directed chain can be transformed into an equivalent undirected chain. Because the directed graph does not have any nodes with more than one parent, this does not require the addition of any extra links, and the directed and undirected versions of this graph express exactly the same set of conditional inde- pendence statements.',\n",

(8.49) We shall consider the speciﬁc case in which the N nodes represent discrete vari- ables each having K states, in which case each potential function ψn−1,n(xn−1, xn) comprises an K × K table, and so the joint distribution has (N −1)K2 parameters. Let us consider the inference problem of ﬁnding the marginal distribution p(xn) for a speciﬁc node xn that is part way along the chain. Note that, for the moment, there are no observed nodes. By deﬁnition, the required marginal is obtained by summing the joint distribution over all variables except xn, so that p(xn) = \\x02 x1 · · · \\x02 xn−1 \\x02 xn+1 · · · \\x02 xN p(x). (8.50) In a naive implementation, we would ﬁrst evaluate the joint distribution and then perform the summations explicitly. The joint distribution can be represented as a set of numbers, one for each possible value for x. Because there are N variables each with K states, there are KN values for x and so evaluation and storage of the joint distribution, as well as marginalization to obtain p(xn), all involve storage and computation that scale exponentially with the length N of the chain. We can, however, obtain a much more efﬁcient algorithm by exploiting the con- ditional independence properties of the graphical model. If we substitute the factor- ized expression (8.49) for the joint distribution into (8.50), then we can rearrange the order of the summations and the multiplications to allow the required marginal to be evaluated much more efﬁciently. Consider for instance the summation over xN. The potential ψN−1,N(xN−1, xN) is the only one that depends on xN, and so we can perform the summation \\x02 xN ψN−1,N(xN−1, xN) (8.51) ﬁrst to give a function of xN−1.',\n",

We can then use this to perform the summation over xN−1, which will involve only this new function together with the potential ψN−2,N−1(xN−2, xN−1), because this is the only other place that xN−1 appears. Similarly, the summation over x1 involves only the potential ψ1,2(x1, x2) and so can be performed separately to give a function of x2, and so on.

(8.52) The reader is encouraged to study this re-ordering carefully as the underlying idea forms the basis for the later discussion of the general sum-product algorithm. Here the key concept that we are exploiting is that multiplication is distributive over addi- tion, so that ab + ac = a(b + c) (8.53) in which the left-hand side involves three arithmetic operations whereas the right- hand side reduces this to two operations. Let us work out the computational cost of evaluating the required marginal using this re-ordered expression. We have to perform N −1 summations each of which is over K states and each of which involves a function of two variables. For instance, the summation over x1 involves only the function ψ1,2(x1, x2), which is a table of K × K numbers. We have to sum this table over x1 for each value of x2 and so this has O(K2) cost. The resulting vector of K numbers is multiplied by the matrix of numbers ψ2,3(x2, x3) and so is again O(K2). Because there are N −1 summations and multiplications of this kind, the total cost of evaluating the marginal p(xn) is O(NK2). This is linear in the length of the chain, in contrast to the exponential cost of a naive approach.',\n",

Simply applying the above procedure separately for each node will have computational cost that is O(N 2M 2). However, such an approach would be very wasteful of computation. For instance, to ﬁnd p(x1) we need to prop- agate a message µβ(·) from node xN back to node x2. Similarly, to evaluate p(x2) we need to propagate a messages µβ(·) from node xN back to node x3. This will involve much duplicated computation because most of the messages will be identical in the two cases. Suppose instead we ﬁrst launch a message µβ(xN−1) starting from node xN and propagate corresponding messages all the way back to node x1, and suppose we similarly launch a message µα(x2) starting from node x1 and propagate the corre- sponding messages all the way forward to node xN. Provided we store all of the intermediate messages along the way, then any node can evaluate its marginal sim- ply by applying (8.54). The computational cost is only twice that for ﬁnding the marginal of a single node, rather than N times as much.

Note also that the normalization constant Z need be evaluated only once, using any convenient node. If some of the nodes in the graph are observed, then the corresponding variables are simply clamped to their observed values and there is no summation. To see this, note that the effect of clamping a variable xn to an observed value \\x01xn can be expressed by multiplying the joint distribution by (one or more copies of) an additional function I(xn, \\x01xn), which takes the value 1 when xn = \\x01xn and the value 0 otherwise. One such function can then be absorbed into each of the potentials that contain xn. Summations over xn then contain only one term in which xn = \\x01xn. Now suppose we wish to calculate the joint distribution p(xn−1, xn) for two neighbouring nodes on the chain. This is similar to the evaluation of the marginal for a single node, except that there are now two variables that are not summed out.

Exercise 8.18 If there are nodes in a directed graph that have more than one parent, but there is still only one path (ignoring the direction of the arrows) between any two nodes, then the graph is a called a polytree, as illustrated in Figure 8.39(c). Such a graph will have more than one node with the property of having no parents, and furthermore, the corresponding moralized undirected graph will have loops.8.4.3 Factor graphs The sum-product algorithm that we derive in the next section is applicable to undirected and directed trees and to polytrees. It can be cast in a particularly simple and general form if we ﬁrst introduce a new graphical construction called a factor graph (Frey, 1998; Kschischnang et al.,2001). Both directed and undirected graphs allow a global function of several vari- ables to be expressed as a product of factors over subsets of those variables. Factor graphs make this decomposition explicit by introducing additional nodes for the fac- tors themselves in addition to the nodes representing the variables. They also allow us to be more explicit about the details of the factorization, as we shall see. Let us write the joint distribution over a set of variables in the form of a product of factors p(x) = \\x0e s fs(xs) (8.59) where xs denotes a subset of the variables.

Each factor fs is a function of a corresponding set of variables xs. Directed graphs, whose factorization is deﬁned by (8.5), represent special cases of (8.59) in which the factors fs(xs) are local conditional distributions. Similarly, undirected graphs, given by (8.39), are a special case in which the factors are po- tential functions over the maximal cliques (the normalizing coefﬁcient 1/Z can be viewed as a factor deﬁned over the empty set of variables). In a factor graph, there is a node (depicted as usual by a circle) for every variable in the distribution, as was the case for directed and undirected graphs. There are also additional nodes (depicted by small squares) for each factor fs(xs) in the joint dis- tribution. Finally, there are undirected links connecting each factor node to all of the variables nodes on which that factor depends. Consider, for example, a distribution that is expressed in terms of the factorization p(x) = fa(x1, x2)fb(x1, x2)fc(x2, x3)fd(x3).

Factor graphs are said to be bipartite because they consist of two distinct kinds of nodes, and all links go between nodes of opposite type. In general, factor graphs can therefore always be drawn as two rows of nodes (variable nodes at the top and factor nodes at the bottom) with links between the rows, as shown in the example in Figure 8.40. In some situations, however, other ways of laying out the graph may be more intuitive, for example when the factor graph is derived from a directed or undirected graph, as we shall see. If we are given a distribution that is expressed in terms of an undirected graph, then we can readily convert it to a factor graph. To do this, we create variable nodes corresponding to the nodes in the original undirected graph, and then create addi- tional factor nodes corresponding to the maximal cliques xs. The factors fs(xs) are then set equal to the clique potentials. Note that there may be several different factor graphs that correspond to the same undirected graph.',\n",

Again, there can be multiple factor graphs all of which correspond to the same directed graph. The conversion of a directed graph to a factor graph is illustrated in Figure 8.42. We have already noted the importance of tree-structured graphs for performing efﬁcient inference. If we take a directed or undirected tree and convert it into a factor graph, then the result will again be a tree (in other words, the factor graph will have no loops, and there will be one and only one path connecting any two nodes). In the case of a directed polytree, conversion to an undirected graph results in loops due to the moralization step, whereas conversion to a factor graph again results in a tree, as illustrated in Figure 8.43. In fact, local cycles in a directed graph due to links connecting parents of a node can be removed on conversion to a factor graph by deﬁning the appropriate factor function, as shown in Figure 8.44.

Here we shall consider only the sum-product algorithm because it is simpler to derive and to apply, as well as being more general. We shall assume that the original graph is an undirected tree or a directed tree or polytree, so that the corresponding factor graph has a tree structure. We ﬁrst convert the original graph into a factor graph so that we can deal with both directed and undirected models using the same framework. Our goal is to exploit the structure of the graph to achieve two things: (i) to obtain an efﬁcient, exact inference algorithm for ﬁnding marginals; (ii) in situations where several marginals are required to allow computations to be shared efﬁciently. We begin by considering the problem of ﬁnding the marginal p(x) for partic- ular variable node x. For the moment, we shall suppose that all of the variables are hidden. Later we shall see how to modify the algorithm to incorporate evidence corresponding to observed variables. By deﬁnition, the marginal is obtained by sum- ming the joint distribution over all variables except x so that p(x) = \\x02 x\\\\x p(x) (8.61) where x \\\\ x denotes the set of variables in x with variable x omitted.',\n",

Here we have deﬁned the following messages from variable nodes to factor nodes µxm→fs(xm) ≡ \\x02 Xsm Gm(xm, Xsm). (8.67) We have therefore introduced two distinct kinds of message, those that go from factor nodes to variable nodes denoted µf→x(x), and those that go from variable nodes to factor nodes denoted µx→f(x). In each case, we see that messages passed along a link are always a function of the variable associated with the variable node that link connects to. The result (8.66) says that to evaluate the message sent by a factor node to a vari- able node along the link connecting them, take the product of the incoming messages along all other links coming into the factor node, multiply by the factor associated with that node, and then marginalize over all of the variables associated with the incoming messages. This is illustrated in Figure 8.47. It is important to note that a factor node can send a message to a variable node once it has received incoming messages from all other neighbouring variable nodes. Finally, we derive an expression for evaluating the messages from variable nodes to factor nodes, again by making use of the (sub-)graph factorization. From Fig- ure 8.48, we see that term Gm(xm, Xsm) associated with node xm is given by a product of terms Fl(xm, Xml) each associated with one of the factor nodes fl that is linked to node xm (excluding node fs), so that Gm(xm, Xsm) = \\x0e l∈ne(xm)\\\\fs Fl(xm, Xml) (8.68) where the product is taken over all neighbours of node xm except for node fs.',\n",

Thus to evaluate the message sent by a variable node to an adjacent factor node along the connecting link, we simply take the product of the incoming messages along all of the other links. Note that any variable node that has only two neighbours performs no computation but simply passes messages through un- changed. Also, we note that a variable node can send a message to a factor node once it has received incoming messages from all other neighbouring factor nodes. Recall that our goal is to calculate the marginal for variable node x, and that this marginal is given by the product of incoming messages along all of the links arriving at that node. Each of these messages can be computed recursively in terms of other messages. In order to start this recursion, we can view the node x as the root of the tree and begin at the leaf nodes. From the deﬁnition (8.69), we see that if a leaf node is a variable node, then the message that it sends along its one and only link is given by µx→f(x) = 1 (8.70) as illustrated in Figure 8.49(a).

At this point, it is worth pausing to summarize the particular version of the sum- product algorithm obtained so far for evaluating the marginal p(x). We start by viewing the variable node x as the root of the factor graph and initiating messages at the leaves of the graph using (8.70) and (8.71). The message passing steps (8.66) and (8.69) are then applied recursively until messages have been propagated along every link, and the root node has received messages from all of its neighbours. Each node can send a message towards the root once it has received messages from all of its other neighbours. Once the root node has received messages from all of its neighbours, the required marginal can be evaluated using (8.63). We shall illustrate this process shortly. To see that each node will always receive enough messages to be able to send out a message, we can use a simple inductive argument as follows. Clearly, for a graph comprising a variable root node connected directly to several factor leaf nodes, the algorithm trivially involves sending messages of the form (8.71) directly from the leaves to the root. Now imagine building up a general graph by adding nodes one at a time, and suppose that for some particular graph we have a valid algorithm.',\n",

It therefore sends a message to the node to which it is linked, which in turn will therefore receive all the messages it requires in order to send its own message towards the root, and so again we have a valid algorithm, thereby completing the proof. Now suppose we wish to ﬁnd the marginals for every variable node in the graph. This could be done by simply running the above algorithm afresh for each such node. However, this would be very wasteful as many of the required computations would be repeated. We can obtain a much more efﬁcient procedure by ‘overlaying’ these multiple message passing algorithms to obtain the general sum-product algorithm as follows. Arbitrarily pick any (variable or factor) node and designate it as the root. Propagate messages from the leaves to the root as before. At this point, the root node will have received messages from all of its neighbours. It can therefore send out messages to all of its neighbours.',\n",

By now, a message will have passed in both directions across every link in the graph, and every node will have received a message from all of its neighbours. Again a simple inductive argument can be used to verify the validity of this message passing protocol. Because every variable Exercise 8.20 node will have received messages from all of its neighbours, we can readily calculate the marginal distribution for every variable in the graph. The number of messages that have to be computed is given by twice the number of links in the graph and so involves only twice the computation involved in ﬁnding a single marginal.

By a similar argument to that used above, it is easy to see that the marginal associated with a factor is given by the Exercise 8.21 product of messages arriving at the factor node and the local factor at that node p(xs) = fs(xs) \\x0e i∈ne(fs) µxi→fs(xi) (8.72) in complete analogy with the marginals at the variable nodes. If the factors are parameterized functions and we wish to learn the values of the parameters using the EM algorithm, then these marginals are precisely the quantities we will need to calculate in the E step, as we shall see in detail when we discuss the hidden Markov model in Chapter 13. The message sent by a variable node to a factor node, as we have seen, is simply the product of the incoming messages on other links. We can if we wish view the sum-product algorithm in a slightly different form by eliminating messages from variable nodes to factor nodes and simply considering messages that are sent out by factor nodes. This is most easily seen by considering the example in Figure 8.50. So far, we have rather neglected the issue of normalization.',\n",

If the factor graph was derived from a directed graph, then the joint distribution is already correctly nor- malized, and so the marginals obtained by the sum-product algorithm will similarly be normalized correctly. However, if we started from an undirected graph, then in general there will be an unknown normalization coefﬁcient 1/Z. As with the simple chain example of Figure 8.38, this is easily handled by working with an unnormal- ized version \\x04p(x) of the joint distribution, where p(x) = \\x04p(x)/Z. We ﬁrst run the sum-product algorithm to ﬁnd the corresponding unnormalized marginals \\x04p(xi). The coefﬁcient 1/Z is then easily obtained by normalizing any one of these marginals, and this is computationally efﬁcient because the normalization is done over a single variable rather than over the entire set of variables as would be required to normalize \\x04p(x) directly.

We shall give an example of the sum-product algorithm applied to a graph of linear-Gaussian variables when we consider linear dynamical systems. Section 13.3 8.4.5 The max-sum algorithm The sum-product algorithm allows us to take a joint distribution p(x) expressed as a factor graph and efﬁciently ﬁnd marginals over the component variables. Two other common tasks are to ﬁnd a setting of the variables that has the largest prob- ability and to ﬁnd the value of that probability. These can be addressed through a closely related algorithm called max-sum, which can be viewed as an application of dynamic programming in the context of graphical models (Cormen et al.,2001). A simple approach to ﬁnding latent variable values having high probability would be to run the sum-product algorithm to obtain the marginals p(xi) for ev- ery variable, and then, for each marginal in turn, to ﬁnd the value x⋆ i that maximizes that marginal. However, this would give the set of values that are individually the most probable. In practice, we typically wish to ﬁnd the set of values that jointly have the largest probability, in other words the vector xmax that maximizes the joint distribution, so that xmax = arg max x p(x) (8.87) for which the corresponding value of the joint probability will be given by p(xmax) = max x p(x).

(8.88) In general, xmax is not the same as the set of x⋆ i values, as we can easily show using a simple example. Consider the joint distribution p(x, y) over two binary variables x, y ∈{0, 1} given in Table 8.1. The joint distribution is maximized by setting x = 1 and y = 0, corresponding the value 0.4. However, the marginal for p(x), obtained by summing over both values of y, is given by p(x = 0) = 0.6 and p(x = 1) = 0.4, and similarly the marginal for y is given by p(y = 0) = 0.7 and p(y = 1) = 0.3, and so the marginals are maximized by x = 0 and y = 0, which corresponds to a value of 0.3 for the joint distribution. In fact, it is not difﬁcult to construct examples for which the set of individually most probable values has probability zero under the joint distribution. Exercise 8.27 We therefore seek an efﬁcient algorithm for ﬁnding the value of x that maxi- mizes the joint distribution p(x) and that will allow us to obtain the value of the joint distribution at its maximum.

In deriving the sum-product algorithm, we made use of the distributive law (8.53) for multiplication. Here we make use of the analogous law for the max operator max(ab, ac) = a max(b, c) (8.90) which holds if a ⩾0 (as will always be the case for the factors in a graphical model). This allows us to exchange products with maximizations. Consider ﬁrst the simple example of a chain of nodes described by (8.49). The evaluation of the probability maximum can be written as max x p(x) = 1 Z max x1 · · · max xN [ψ1,2(x1, x2) · · · ψN−1,N(xN−1, xN)] = 1 Z max x1 \\x1d ψ1,2(x1, x2) \\x1d · · · max xN ψN−1,N(xN−1, xN) \\x1e\\x1e . As with the calculation of marginals, we see that exchanging the max and product operators results in a much more efﬁcient computation, and one that is easily inter- preted in terms of messages passed from node xN backwards along the chain to node x1. We can readily generalize this result to arbitrary tree-structured factor graphs by substituting the expression (8.59) for the factor graph expansion into (8.89) and again exchanging maximizations with products. The structure of this calculation is identical to that of the sum-product algorithm, and so we can simply translate those results into the present context. In particular, suppose that we designate a particular variable node as the ‘root’ of the graph.',\n",

The ﬁnal maximization is performed over the product of all messages arriving at the root node, and gives the maximum value for p(x). This could be called the max-product algorithm and is identical to the sum-product algorithm except that summations are replaced by maximizations. Note that at this stage, messages have been sent from leaves to the root, but not in the other direction. In practice, products of many small probabilities can lead to numerical under- ﬂow problems, and so it is convenient to work with the logarithm of the joint distri- bution. The logarithm is a monotonic function, so that if a > b then ln a > ln b, and hence the max operator and the logarithm function can be interchanged, so that ln \\x11 max x p(x) \\x12 = max x ln p(x). (8.91) The distributive property is preserved because max(a + b, a + c) = a + max(b, c).

The result will be the same irrespective of which node is chosen as the root. Now we turn to the second problem of ﬁnding the conﬁguration of the variables for which the joint dis- tribution attains this maximum value. So far, we have sent messages from the leaves to the root. The process of evaluating (8.97) will also give the value xmax for the most probable value of the root node variable, deﬁned by xmax = arg max x ⎡ ⎣\\x02 s∈ne(x) µfs→x(x) ⎤ ⎦.

However, because we are now maximizing rather than summing, it is possible that there may be mul- tiple conﬁgurations of x all of which give rise to the maximum value for p(x). In such cases, this strategy can fail because it is possible for the individual variable values obtained by maximizing the product of messages at each node to belong to different maximizing conﬁgurations, giving an overall conﬁguration that no longer corresponds to a maximum.

Once we know the most probable value of the ﬁ- nal node xN, we can then simply follow the link back to ﬁnd the most probable state of node xN−1 and so on back to the initial node x1. This corresponds to propagating a message back down the chain using xmax n−1 = φ(xmax n ) (8.102) and is known as back-tracking. Note that there could be several values of xn−1 all of which give the maximum value in (8.101). Provided we chose one of these values when we do the back-tracking, we are assured of a globally consistent maximizing conﬁguration. In Figure 8.53, we have indicated two paths, each of which we shall suppose corresponds to a global maximum of the joint probability distribution. If k = 2 and k = 3 each represent possible values of xmax N , then starting from either state and tracing back along the black lines, which corresponds to iterating (8.102), we obtain a valid global maximum conﬁguration. Note that if we had run a forward pass of max-sum message passing followed by a backward pass and then applied (8.98) at each node separately, we could end up selecting some states from one path and some from the other path, giving an overall conﬁguration that is not a global maximizer. We see that it is necessary instead to keep track of the maximizing states during the forward pass using the functions φ(xn) and then use back-tracking to ﬁnd a consistent solution.

GRAPHICAL MODELS 8.4.6 Exact inference in general graphs The sum-product and max-sum algorithms provide efﬁcient and exact solutions to inference problems in tree-structured graphs. For many practical applications, however, we have to deal with graphs having loops. The message passing framework can be generalized to arbitrary graph topolo- gies, giving an exact inference procedure known as the junction tree algorithm (Lau- ritzen and Spiegelhalter, 1988; Jordan, 2007). Here we give a brief outline of the key steps involved. This is not intended to convey a detailed understanding of the algorithm, but rather to give a ﬂavour of the various stages involved. If the starting point is a directed graph, it is ﬁrst converted to an undirected graph by moraliza- tion, whereas if starting from an undirected graph this step is not required. Next the graph is triangulated, which involves ﬁnding chord-less cycles containing four or more nodes and adding extra links to eliminate such chord-less cycles. For instance, in the graph in Figure 8.36, the cycle A–C–B–D–A is chord-less a link could be added between A and B or alternatively between C and D. Note that the joint dis- tribution for the resulting triangulated graph is still deﬁned by a product of the same potential functions, but these are now considered to be functions over expanded sets of variables. Next the triangulated graph is used to construct a new tree-structured undirected graph called a join tree, whose nodes correspond to the maximal cliques of the triangulated graph, and whose links connect pairs of cliques that have vari- ables in common. The selection of which pairs of cliques to connect in this way is important and is done so as to give a maximal spanning tree deﬁned as follows.',\n",

If the tree is condensed, so that any clique that is a subset of another clique is absorbed into the larger clique, this gives a junction tree. As a consequence of the triangulation step, the resulting tree satisﬁes the running intersection property, which means that if a variable is contained in two cliques, then it must also be con- tained in every clique on the path that connects them. This ensures that inference about variables will be consistent across the graph. Finally, a two-stage message passing algorithm, essentially equivalent to the sum-product algorithm, can now be applied to this junction tree in order to ﬁnd marginals and conditionals. Although the junction tree algorithm sounds complicated, at its heart is the simple idea that we have used already of exploiting the factorization properties of the distribution to allow sums and products to be interchanged so that partial summations can be per- formed, thereby avoiding having to work directly with the joint distribution. The role of the junction tree is to provide a precise and efﬁcient way to organize these computations. It is worth emphasizing that this is achieved using purely graphical operations!The junction tree is exact for arbitrary graphs and is efﬁcient in the sense that for a given graph there does not in general exist a computationally cheaper approach. Unfortunately, the algorithm must work with the joint distributions within each node (each of which corresponds to a clique of the triangulated graph) and so the compu- tational cost of the algorithm is determined by the number of variables in the largest',\n",

An important concept is the treewidth of a graph (Bodlaender, 1993), which is de- ﬁned in terms of the number of variables in the largest clique. In fact, it is deﬁned to be as one less than the size of the largest clique, to ensure that a tree has a treewidth of 1. Because there in general there can be multiple different junction trees that can be constructed from a given starting graph, the treewidth is deﬁned by the junction tree for which the largest clique has the fewest variables. If the treewidth of the original graph is high, the junction tree algorithm becomes impractical.8.4.7 Loopy belief propagation For many problems of practical interest, it will not be feasible to use exact in- ference, and so we need to exploit effective approximation methods. An important class of such approximations, that can broadly be called variational methods, will be discussed in detail in Chapter 10. Complementing these deterministic approaches is a wide range of sampling methods, also called Monte Carlo methods, that are based on stochastic numerical sampling from distributions and that will be discussed at length in Chapter 11. Here we consider one simple approach to approximate inference in graphs with loops, which builds directly on the previous discussion of exact inference in trees. The idea is simply to apply the sum-product algorithm even though there is no guar- antee that it will yield good results.',\n",

This approach is known as loopy belief propa- gation (Frey and MacKay, 1998) and is possible because the message passing rules (8.66) and (8.69) for the sum-product algorithm are purely local. However, because the graph now has cycles, information can ﬂow many times around the graph. For some models, the algorithm will converge, whereas for others it will not. In order to apply this approach, we need to deﬁne a message passing schedule. Let us assume that one message is passed at a time on any given link and in any given direction. Each message sent from a node replaces any previous message sent in the same direction across the same link and will itself be a function only of the most recent messages received by that node at previous steps of the algorithm. We have seen that a message can only be sent across a link from a node when all other messages have been received by that node across its other links. Because there are loops in the graph, this raises the problem of how to initiate the message passing algorithm. To resolve this, we suppose that an initial message given by the unit function has been passed across every link in each direction. Every node is then in a position to send a message.',\n",

Following Kschischnang et al. (2001), we will say that a (variable or factor) node a has a message pending on its link to a node b if node a has received any message on any of its other links since the last time it send a message to b.

For graphs that have a tree structure, any schedule that sends only pending messages will eventually terminate once a message has passed in each direction across every link. At this point, there are no pending messages, and the product of the received Exercise 8.29 messages at every variable give the exact marginal. In graphs having loops, however, the algorithm may never terminate because there might always be pending messages, although in practice it is generally found to converge within a reasonable time for most applications. Once the algorithm has converged, or once it has been stopped if convergence is not observed, the (approximate) local marginals can be computed using the product of the most recently received incoming messages to each variable node or factor node on every link. In some applications, the loopy belief propagation algorithm can give poor re- sults, whereas in other applications it has proven to be very effective. In particular, state-of-the-art algorithms for decoding certain kinds of error-correcting codes are equivalent to loopy belief propagation (Gallager, 1963; Berrou et al.,1993; McEliece et al.,1998; MacKay and Neal, 1999; Frey, 1998).8.4.8 Learning the graph structure In our discussion of inference in graphical models, we have assumed that the structure of the graph is known and ﬁxed.',\n",

However, there is also interest in go- ing beyond the inference problem and learning the graph structure itself from data (Friedman and Koller, 2003). This requires that we deﬁne a space of possible struc- tures as well as a measure that can be used to score each structure. From a Bayesian viewpoint, we would ideally like to compute a posterior dis- tribution over graph structures and to make predictions by averaging with respect to this distribution. If we have a prior p(m) over graphs indexed by m, then the posterior distribution is given by p(m|D) ∝p(m)p(D|m) (8.103) where D is the observed data set. The model evidence p(D|m) then provides the score for each model. However, evaluation of the evidence involves marginalization over the latent variables and presents a challenging computational problem for many models. Exploring the space of structures can also be problematic. Because the number of different graph structures grows exponentially with the number of nodes, it is often necessary to resort to heuristics to ﬁnd good candidates.

The introduction of latent variables thereby allows complicated distributions to be formed from simpler components. In this chapter, we shall see that mixture distributions, such as the Gaussian mixture discussed in Section 2.3.9, can be interpreted in terms of discrete latent variables. Continuous latent variables will form the subject of Chapter 12. As well as providing a framework for building more complex probability dis- tributions, mixture models can also be used to cluster data. We therefore begin our discussion of mixture distributions by considering the problem of ﬁnding clusters in a set of data points, which we approach ﬁrst using a nonprobabilistic technique called the K-means algorithm (Lloyd, 1982).

A gen- Section 9.2 eral technique for ﬁnding maximum likelihood estimators in latent variable models is the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. We ﬁrst of all use the Gaussian mixture distribution to motivate the EM algorithm in a fairly informal way, and then we give a more careful treatment based on the latent variable viewpoint. We shall Section 9.3 see that the K-means algorithm corresponds to a particular nonprobabilistic limit of EM applied to mixtures of Gaussians. Finally, we discuss EM in some generality. Section 9.4 Gaussian mixture models are widely used in data mining, pattern recognition, machine learning, and statistical analysis. In many applications, their parameters are determined by maximum likelihood, typically using the EM algorithm. However, as we shall see there are some signiﬁcant limitations to the maximum likelihood ap- proach, and in Chapter 10 we shall show that an elegant Bayesian treatment can be given using the framework of variational inference. This requires little additional computation compared with EM, and it resolves the principal difﬁculties of maxi- mum likelihood while also allowing the number of components in the mixture to be inferred automatically from the data.9.1.',\n",

Suppose we have a data set {x1, . . . ,xN} consisting of N observations of a random D-dimensional Euclidean variable x. Our goal is to partition the data set into some number K of clusters, where we shall suppose for the moment that the value of K is given. Intuitively, we might think of a cluster as comprising a group of data points whose inter-point distances are small compared with the distances to points outside of the cluster. We can formalize this notion by ﬁrst introducing a set of D-dimensional vectors µk, where k = 1, . . . ,K, in which µk is a prototype associated with the kth cluster. As we shall see shortly, we can think of the µk as representing the centres of the clusters. Our goal is then to ﬁnd an assignment of data points to clusters, as well as a set of vectors {µk}, such that the sum of the squares of the distances of each data point to its closest vector µk, is a minimum. It is convenient at this point to deﬁne some notation to describe the assignment of data points to clusters.

First we choose some initial values for the µk. Then in the ﬁrst phase we minimize J with respect to the rnk, keeping the µk ﬁxed. In the second phase we minimize J with respect to the µk, keeping rnk ﬁxed. This two-stage optimization is then repeated until convergence. We shall see that these two stages of updating rnk and updating µk correspond respectively to the E (expectation) and M (maximization) steps of the EM algorithm, and to emphasize this we shall use the Section 9.4 terms E step and M step in the context of the K-means algorithm. Consider ﬁrst the determination of the rnk. Because J in (9.1) is a linear func- tion of rnk, this optimization can be performed easily to give a closed form solution. The terms involving different n are independent and so we can optimize for each n separately by choosing rnk to be 1 for whichever value of k gives the minimum value of ∥xn −µk∥2.',\n",

In other words, we simply assign the nth data point to the closest cluster centre. More formally, this can be expressed as rnk = \\x0c1 if k = arg minj ∥xn −µj∥2 0 otherwise. (9.2) Now consider the optimization of the µk with the rnk held ﬁxed. The objective function J is a quadratic function of µk, and it can be minimized by setting its derivative with respect to µk to zero giving 2 N \\x02 n=1 rnk(xn −µk) = 0 (9.3) which we can easily solve for µk to give µk = \\x05 n rnkxn \\x05 n rnk . (9.4) The denominator in this expression is equal to the number of points assigned to cluster k, and so this result has a simple interpretation, namely set µk equal to the mean of all of the data points xn assigned to cluster k. For this reason, the procedure is known as the K-means algorithm. The two phases of re-assigning data points to clusters and re-computing the clus- ter means are repeated in turn until there is no further change in the assignments (or until some maximum number of iterations is exceeded). Because each phase reduces the value of the objective function J, convergence of the algorithm is assured. How- Exercise 9.1 ever, it may converge to a local rather than global minimum of J. The convergence properties of the K-means algorithm were studied by MacQueen (1967). The K-means algorithm is illustrated using the Old Faithful data set in Fig- Appendix A ure 9.1.

A plot of the cost function J given by (9.1) for the Old Faithful example is shown in Figure 9.2. Note that we have deliberately chosen poor initial values for the cluster centres so that the algorithm takes several steps before convergence. In practice, a better initialization procedure would be to choose the cluster centres µk to be equal to a random subset of K data points. It is also worth noting that the K-means algorithm itself is often used to initialize the parameters in a Gaussian mixture model before applying the EM algorithm. Section 9.2.2 A direct implementation of the K-means algorithm as discussed here can be relatively slow, because in each E step it is necessary to compute the Euclidean dis- tance between every prototype vector and every data point. Various schemes have been proposed for speeding up the K-means algorithm, some of which are based on precomputing a data structure such as a tree such that nearby points are in the same subtree (Ramasubramanian and Paliwal, 1990; Moore, 2000). Other approaches make use of the triangle inequality for distances, thereby avoiding unnecessary dis- tance calculations (Hodgson, 1998; Elkan, 2003).',\n",

So far, we have considered a batch version of K-means in which the whole data set is used together to update the prototype vectors. We can also derive an on-line stochastic algorithm (MacQueen, 1967) by applying the Robbins-Monro procedure Section 2.3.5 to the problem of ﬁnding the roots of the regression function given by the derivatives of J in (9.1) with respect to µk. This leads to a sequential update in which, for each Exercise 9.2 data point xn in turn, we update the nearest prototype µk using µnew k = µold k + ηn(xn −µold k ) (9.5) where ηn is the learning rate parameter, which is typically made to decrease mono- tonically as more data points are considered. The K-means algorithm is based on the use of squared Euclidean distance as the measure of dissimilarity between a data point and a prototype vector. Not only does this limit the type of data variables that can be considered (it would be inappropriate for cases where some or all of the variables represent categorical labels for instance),',\n",

We Section 2.3.7 can generalize the K-means algorithm by introducing a more general dissimilarity measure V(x, x′) between two vectors x and x′ and then minimizing the following distortion measure \\x04J = N \\x02 n=1 K \\x02 k=1 rnkV(xn, µk) (9.6) which gives the K-medoids algorithm. The E step again involves, for given cluster prototypes µk, assigning each data point to the cluster for which the dissimilarity to the corresponding prototype is smallest. The computational cost of this is O(KN), as is the case for the standard K-means algorithm. For a general choice of dissimi- larity measure, the M step is potentially more complex than for K-means, and so it is common to restrict each cluster prototype to be equal to one of the data vectors as- signed to that cluster, as this allows the algorithm to be implemented for any choice of dissimilarity measure V(·, ·) so long as it can be readily evaluated. Thus the M step involves, for each cluster k, a discrete search over the Nk points assigned to that cluster, which requires O(N 2 k) evaluations of V(·, ·). One notable feature of the K-means algorithm is that at each iteration, every data point is assigned uniquely to one, and only one, of the clusters. Whereas some data points will be much closer to a particular centre µk than to any other centre, there may be other data points that lie roughly midway between cluster centres. In the latter case, it is not clear that the hard assignment to the nearest cluster is the most appropriate. We shall see in the next section that by adopting a probabilistic approach, we obtain ‘soft’ assignments of data points to clusters in a way that reﬂects the level of uncertainty over the most appropriate assignment.',\n",

This probabilistic formulation brings with it numerous beneﬁts.9.1.1 Image segmentation and compression As an illustration of the application of the K-means algorithm, we consider the related problems of image segmentation and image compression. The goal of segmentation is to partition an image into regions each of which has a reasonably homogeneous visual appearance or which corresponds to objects or parts of objects (Forsyth and Ponce, 2003). Each pixel in an image is a point in a 3-dimensional space comprising the intensities of the red, blue, and green channels, and our segmentation algorithm simply treats each pixel in the image as a separate data point. Note that strictly this space is not Euclidean because the channel intensities are bounded by the interval [0, 1]. Nevertheless, we can apply the K-means algorithm without difﬁ- culty. We illustrate the result of running K-means to convergence, for any particular value of K, by re-drawing the image replacing each pixel vector with the {R, G, B} intensity triplet given by the centre µk to which that pixel has been assigned. Results for various values of K are shown in Figure 9.3. We see that for a given value of K, the algorithm is representing the image using a palette of only K colours. It should be emphasized that this use of K-means is not a particularly sophisticated approach to image segmentation, not least because it takes no account of the spatial proximity of different pixels.',\n",

This also illustrates of the use of vector quantization for data compression, in which smaller values of K give higher compression at the expense of poorer image quality.and remains the subject of active research and is introduced here simply to illustrate the behaviour of the K-means algorithm. We can also use the result of a clustering algorithm to perform data compres- sion. It is important to distinguish between lossless data compression, in which the goal is to be able to reconstruct the original data exactly from the compressed representation, and lossy data compression, in which we accept some errors in the reconstruction in return for higher levels of compression than can be achieved in the lossless case. We can apply the K-means algorithm to the problem of lossy data compression as follows. For each of the N data points, we store only the identity k of the cluster to which it is assigned. We also store the values of the K clus- ter centres µk, which typically requires signiﬁcantly less data, provided we choose K ≪N. Each data point is then approximated by its nearest centre µk. New data points can similarly be compressed by ﬁrst ﬁnding the nearest µk and then storing the label k instead of the original data vector. This framework is often called vector quantization, and the vectors µk are called code-book vectors.',\n",

Suppose the original image has N pixels comprising {R, G, B} values each of which is stored with 8 bits of precision. Then to transmit the whole image directly would cost 24N bits. Now suppose we ﬁrst run K-means on the image data, and then instead of transmitting the original pixel intensity vectors we transmit the identity of the nearest vector µk. Because there are K such vectors, this requires log2 K bits per pixel. We must also transmit the K code book vectors µk, which requires 24K bits, and so the total number of bits required to transmit the image is 24K + N log2 K (rounding up to the nearest integer). The original image shown in Figure 9.3 has 240 × 180 = 43, 200 pixels and so requires 24 × 43, 200 = 1, 036, 800 bits to transmit directly. By comparison, the compressed images require 43, 248 bits (K = 2), 86, 472 bits (K = 3), and 173, 040 bits (K = 10), respectively, to transmit. These represent compression ratios compared to the original image of 4.2%, 8.3%, and 16.7%, respectively. We see that there is a trade-off between degree of compression and image quality.',\n",

Mixtures of Gaussians In Section 2.3.9 we motivated the Gaussian mixture model as a simple linear super- position of Gaussian components, aimed at providing a richer class of density mod- els than the single Gaussian. We now turn to a formulation of Gaussian mixtures in terms of discrete latent variables. This will provide us with a deeper insight into this important distribution, and will also serve to motivate the expectation-maximization algorithm. Recall from (2.188) that the Gaussian mixture distribution can be written as a linear superposition of Gaussians in the form p(x) = K \\x02 k=1 πkN(x|µk, Σk). (9.7) Let us introduce a K-dimensional binary random variable z having a 1-of-K repre- sentation in which a particular element zk is equal to 1 and all other elements are equal to 0. The values of zk therefore satisfy zk ∈{0, 1} and \\x05 k zk = 1, and we see that there are K possible states for the vector z according to which element is nonzero.

Because z uses a 1-of-K representation, we can also write this distribution in the form p(z) = K \\x0e k=1 πzk k . (9.10) Similarly, the conditional distribution of x given a particular value for z is a Gaussian p(x|zk = 1) = N(x|µk, Σk) which can also be written in the form p(x|z) = K \\x0e k=1 N(x|µk, Σk)zk.

MIXTURE MODELS AND EM instead of the marginal distribution p(x), and this will lead to signiﬁcant simpliﬁca- tions, most notably through the introduction of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Another quantity that will play an important role is the conditional probability of z given x. We shall use γ(zk) to denote p(zk = 1|x), whose value can be found using Bayes’ theorem γ(zk) ≡p(zk = 1|x) = p(zk = 1)p(x|zk = 1) K \\x02 j=1 p(zj = 1)p(x|zj = 1) = πkN(x|µk, Σk) K \\x02 j=1 πjN(x|µj, Σj) . (9.13) We shall view πk as the prior probability of zk = 1, and the quantity γ(zk) as the corresponding posterior probability once we have observed x. As we shall see later, γ(zk) can also be viewed as the responsibility that component k takes for ‘explain- ing’ the observation x. We can use the technique of ancestral sampling to generate random samples Section 8.1.2 distributed according to the Gaussian mixture model. To do this, we ﬁrst generate a value for z, which we denote \\x01z, from the marginal distribution p(z) and then generate a value for x from the conditional distribution p(x|\\x01z). Techniques for sampling from standard distributions are discussed in Chapter 11. We can depict samples from the joint distribution p(x, z) by plotting points at the corresponding values of x and then colouring them according to the value of z, in other words according to which Gaussian component was responsible for generating them, as shown in Figure 9.5(a). Similarly samples from the marginal distribution p(x) are obtained by taking the samples from the joint distribution and ignoring the values of z. These are illustrated in Figure 9.5(b) by plotting the x values without any coloured labels. We can also use this synthetic data set to illustrate the ‘responsibilities’ by eval- uating, for every data point, the posterior probability for each component in the mixture distribution from which this data set was generated. In particular, we can represent the value of the responsibilities γ(znk) associated with data point xn by plotting the corresponding point using proportions of red, blue, and green ink given by γ(znk) for k = 1, 2, 3, respectively, as shown in Figure 9.5(c).

Thus the maximization of the log likelihood function is not a well posed problem because such singularities will always be present and will occur whenever one of the Gaussian components ‘collapses’ onto a speciﬁc data point. Recall that this problem did not arise in the case of a single Gaussian distribution. To understand the difference, note that if a single Gaussian collapses onto a data point it will contribute multiplicative factors to the likelihood function arising from the other data points and these factors will go to zero exponentially fast, giving an overall likelihood that goes to zero rather than inﬁnity. However, once we have (at least) two components in the mixture, one of the components can have a ﬁnite variance and therefore assign ﬁnite probability to all of the data points while the other component can shrink onto one speciﬁc data point and thereby contribute an ever increasing additive value to the log likelihood. This is illustrated in Figure 9.7. These singularities provide another example of the severe over-ﬁtting that can occur in a maximum likelihood approach.',\n",

For the moment, Section 10.1 however, we simply note that in applying maximum likelihood to Gaussian mixture models we must take steps to avoid ﬁnding such pathological solutions and instead seek local maxima of the likelihood function that are well behaved. We can hope to avoid the singularities by using suitable heuristics, for instance by detecting when a Gaussian component is collapsing and resetting its mean to a randomly chosen value while also resetting its covariance to some large value, and then continuing with the optimization. A further issue in ﬁnding maximum likelihood solutions arises from the fact that for any given maximum likelihood solution, a K-component mixture will have a total of K!equivalent solutions corresponding to the K!ways of assigning K sets of parameters to K components. In other words, for any given (nondegenerate) point in the space of parameter values there will be a further K!−1 additional points all of which give rise to exactly the same distribution.

Identiﬁability will also arise when we discuss models having continuous latent variables in Chapter 12. However, for the purposes of ﬁnding a good density model, it is irrelevant because any of the equivalent solutions is as good as any other. Maximizing the log likelihood function (9.14) for a Gaussian mixture model turns out to be a more complex problem than for the case of a single Gaussian. The difﬁculty arises from the presence of the summation over k that appears inside the logarithm in (9.14), so that the logarithm function no longer acts directly on the Gaussian. If we set the derivatives of the log likelihood to zero, we will no longer obtain a closed form solution, as we shall see shortly. One approach is to apply gradient-based optimization techniques (Fletcher, 1987; Nocedal and Wright, 1999; Bishop and Nabney, 2008). Although gradient-based techniques are feasible, and indeed will play an important role when we discuss mixture density networks in Chapter 5, we now consider an alternative approach known as the EM algorithm which has broad applicability and which will lay the foundations for a discussion of variational inference techniques in Chapter 10.9.2.2 EM for Gaussian mixtures An elegant and powerful method for ﬁnding maximum likelihood solutions for models with latent variables is called the expectation-maximization algorithm, or EM algorithm (Dempster et al.,1977; McLachlan and Krishnan, 1997).',\n",

Initially, we shall motivate the EM Section 10.1 algorithm by giving a relatively informal treatment in the context of the Gaussian mixture model. We emphasize, however, that EM has broad applicability, and indeed it will be encountered in the context of a variety of different models in this book. Let us begin by writing down the conditions that must be satisﬁed at a maximum of the likelihood function. Setting the derivatives of ln p(X|π, µ, Σ) in (9.14) with respect to the means µk of the Gaussian components to zero, we obtain 0 = − N \\x02 n=1 πkN(xn|µk, Σk) \\x05 j πjN(xn|µj, Σj) ( )* + γ(znk) Σk(xn −µk) (9.16) where we have made use of the form (2.43) for the Gaussian distribution. Note that the posterior probabilities, or responsibilities, given by (9.13) appear naturally on the right-hand side. Multiplying by Σ−1 k (which we assume to be nonsingular) and rearranging we obtain µk = 1 Nk N \\x02 n=1 γ(znk)xn (9.17) where we have deﬁned Nk = N \\x02 n=1 γ(znk). (9.18)',\n",

       "  'sentence_chunk': '436 9. MIXTURE MODELS AND EM We can interpret Nk as the effective number of points assigned to cluster k. Note carefully the form of this solution. We see that the mean µk for the kth Gaussian component is obtained by taking a weighted mean of all of the points in the data set, in which the weighting factor for data point xn is given by the posterior probability γ(znk) that component k was responsible for generating xn. If we set the derivative of ln p(X|π, µ, Σ) with respect to Σk to zero, and follow a similar line of reasoning, making use of the result for the maximum likelihood solution for the covariance matrix of a single Gaussian, we obtain Section 2.3.4 Σk = 1 Nk N \\x02 n=1 γ(znk)(xn −µk)(xn −µk)T (9.19) which has the same form as the corresponding result for a single Gaussian ﬁtted to the data set, but again with each data point weighted by the corresponding poste- rior probability and with the denominator given by the effective number of points associated with the corresponding component. Finally, we maximize ln p(X|π, µ, Σ) with respect to the mixing coefﬁcients πk. Here we must take account of the constraint (9.9), which requires the mixing coefﬁcients to sum to one. This can be achieved using a Lagrange multiplier and Appendix E maximizing the following quantity ln p(X|π, µ, Σ) + λ \\x16 K \\x02 k=1 πk −1 \\x17 (9.20) which gives 0 = N \\x02 n=1 N(xn|µk, Σk) \\x05 j πjN(xn|µj, Σj) + λ (9.21) where again we see the appearance of the responsibilities. If we now multiply both sides by πk and sum over k making use of the constraint (9.9), we ﬁnd λ = −N. Using this to eliminate λ and rearranging we obtain πk = Nk N (9.22) so that the mixing coefﬁcient for the kth component is given by the average respon- sibility which that component takes for explaining the data points. It is worth emphasizing that the results (9.17), (9.19), and (9.22) do not con- stitute a closed-form solution for the parameters of the mixture model because the responsibilities γ(znk) depend on those parameters in a complex way through (9.13). However, these results do suggest a simple iterative scheme for ﬁnding a solution to the maximum likelihood problem, which as we shall see turns out to be an instance of the EM algorithm for the particular case of the Gaussian mixture model.

In practice, the algorithm is deemed to have converged when the change Section 9.4 in the log likelihood function, or alternatively in the parameters, falls below some threshold.

Thus, points that have a signiﬁcant probability for belonging to either cluster appear purple. The situation after the ﬁrst M step is shown in plot (c), in which the mean of the blue Gaussian has moved to the mean of the data set, weighted by the probabilities of each data point belonging to the blue cluster, in other words it has moved to the centre of mass of the blue ink. Similarly, the covariance of the blue Gaussian is set equal to the covariance of the blue ink. Analogous results hold for the red component. Plots (d), (e), and (f) show the results after 2, 5, and 20 complete cycles of EM, respectively. In plot (f) the algorithm is close to convergence.

Now suppose that, for each observation in X, we were told the corresponding value of the latent variable Z. We shall call {X, Z} the complete data set, and we shall refer to the actual observed data X as incomplete, as illustrated in Figure 9.5. The likelihood function for the complete data set simply takes the form ln p(X, Z|θ), and we shall suppose that maximization of this complete-data log likelihood function is straightforward. In practice, however, we are not given the complete data set {X, Z}, but only the incomplete data X. Our state of knowledge of the values of the latent variables in Z is given only by the posterior distribution p(Z|X, θ). Because we cannot use the complete-data log likelihood, we consider instead its expected value under the posterior distribution of the latent variable, which corresponds (as we shall see) to the E step of the EM algorithm. In the subsequent M step, we maximize this expectation. If the current estimate for the parameters is denoted θold, then a pair of successive E and M steps gives rise to a revised estimate θnew.

The distribution of the observed values is obtained by taking the joint distribution of all the variables and then marginalizing over the missing ones. EM can then be used to maximize the corresponding likelihood function. We shall show an example of the application of this technique in the context of principal component analysis in Figure 12.11. This will be a valid procedure if the data values are missing at random, meaning that the mechanism causing values to be missing does not depend on the unobserved values. In many situations this will not be the case, for instance if a sensor fails to return a value whenever the quantity it is measuring exceeds some threshold.9.3.1 Gaussian mixtures revisited We now consider the application of this latent variable view of EM to the spe- ciﬁc case of a Gaussian mixture model. Recall that our goal is to maximize the log likelihood function (9.14), which is computed using the observed data set X, and we saw that this was more difﬁcult than for the case of a single Gaussian distribution due to the presence of the summation over k that occurs inside the logarithm.

The loga- rithm now acts directly on the Gaussian distribution, which itself is a member of the exponential family. Not surprisingly, this leads to a much simpler solution to the maximum likelihood problem, as we now show. Consider ﬁrst the maximization with respect to the means and covariances. Because zn is a K-dimensional vec- tor with all elements equal to 0 except for a single element having the value 1, the complete-data log likelihood function is simply a sum of K independent contribu- tions, one for each mixture component.

We then keep the responsibilities ﬁxed and maximize (9.40) with respect to µk, Σk and πk (the M step).

Whereas the K-means algorithm performs a hard assignment of data points to clusters, in which each data point is associated uniquely with one cluster, the EM algorithm makes a soft assignment based on the posterior probabilities. In fact, we can derive the K-means algorithm as a particular limit of EM for Gaussian mixtures as follows.

(9.41) We now consider the EM algorithm for a mixture of K Gaussians of this form in which we treat ϵ as a ﬁxed constant, instead of a parameter to be re-estimated. From (9.13) the posterior probabilities, or responsibilities, for a particular data point xn, are given by γ(znk) = πk exp {−∥xn −µk∥2/2ϵ} \\x05 j πj exp \\x1a −∥xn −µj∥2/2ϵ\\x1b. (9.42) If we consider the limit ϵ →0, we see that in the denominator the term for which ∥xn −µj∥2 is smallest will go to zero most slowly, and hence the responsibilities γ(znk) for the data point xn all go to zero except for term j, for which the responsi- bility γ(znj) will go to unity. Note that this holds independently of the values of the πk so long as none of the πk is zero. Thus, in this limit, we obtain a hard assignment of data points to clusters, just as in the K-means algorithm, so that γ(znk) →rnk where rnk is deﬁned by (9.2). Each data point is thereby assigned to the cluster having the closest mean. The EM re-estimation equation for the µk, given by (9.17), then reduces to the K-means result (9.4). Note that the re-estimation formula for the mixing coefﬁcients (9.22) simply re-sets the value of πk to be equal to the fraction of data points assigned to cluster k, although these parameters no longer play an active role in the algorithm.

A hard-assignment version of the Gaussian mixture model with general covariance matrices, known as the elliptical K-means algorithm, has been considered by Sung and Poggio (1994).9.3.3 Mixtures of Bernoulli distributions So far in this chapter, we have focussed on distributions over continuous vari- ables described by mixtures of Gaussians. As a further example of mixture mod- elling, and to illustrate the EM algorithm in a different context, we now discuss mix- tures of discrete binary variables described by Bernoulli distributions. This model is also known as latent class analysis (Lazarsfeld and Henry, 1968; McLachlan and Peel, 2000).

As in the case of the Gaussian mixture, z = (z1, . . . ,zK)T is a binary K-dimensional variable having a single component equal to 1, with all other components equal to 0. We can then write the conditional distribution of x, given the latent variable, as p(x|z, µ) = K \\x0e k=1 p(x|µk)zk (9.52) while the prior distribution for the latent variables is the same as for the mixture of Gaussians model, so that p(z|π) = K \\x0e k=1 πzk k .

In the M step, we maximize the expected complete-data log likelihood with respect to the parameters µk and π. If we set the derivative of (9.55) with respect to µk equal to zero and rearrange the terms, we obtain Exercise 9.15 µk = xk. (9.59) We see that this sets the mean of component k equal to a weighted mean of the data, with weighting coefﬁcients given by the responsibilities that component k takes for data points. For the maximization with respect to πk, we need to introduce a Lagrange multiplier to enforce the constraint \\x05 k πk = 1. Following analogous steps to those used for the mixture of Gaussians, we then obtain Exercise 9.16 πk = Nk N (9.60) which represents the intuitively reasonable result that the mixing coefﬁcient for com- ponent k is given by the effective fraction of points in the data set explained by that component. Note that in contrast to the mixture of Gaussians, there are no singularities in which the likelihood function goes to inﬁnity. This can be seen by noting that the likelihood function is bounded above because 0 ⩽p(xn|µk) ⩽1. There exist Exercise 9.17 singularities at which the likelihood function goes to zero, but these will not be found by EM provided it is not initialized to a pathological starting point, because the EM algorithm always increases the value of the likelihood function, until a local maximum is found.

The q distribution is set equal to the posterior distribution for the current parameter val- ues θold, causing the lower bound to move up to the same value as the log like- lihood function, with the KL divergence vanishing.ln p(X|θold) L(q, θold) KL(q||p) = 0 shown in Figure 9.13. If we substitute q(Z) = p(Z|X, θold) into (9.71), we see that, after the E step, the lower bound takes the form L(q, θ) = \\x02 Z p(Z|X, θold) ln p(X, Z|θ) − \\x02 Z p(Z|X, θold) ln p(Z|X, θold) = Q(θ, θold) + const (9.74) where the constant is simply the negative entropy of the q distribution and is there- fore independent of θ. Thus in the M step, the quantity that is being maximized is the expectation of the complete-data log likelihood, as we saw earlier in the case of mix- tures of Gaussians. Note that the variable θ over which we are optimizing appears only inside the logarithm. If the joint distribution p(Z, X|θ) comprises a member of the exponential family, or a product of such members, then we see that the logarithm will cancel the exponential and lead to an M step that will be typically much simpler than the maximization of the corresponding incomplete-data log likelihood function p(X|θ). The operation of the EM algorithm can also be viewed in the space of parame- ters, as illustrated schematically in Figure 9.14. Here the red curve depicts the (in- Figure 9.13 Illustration of the M step of the EM algorithm.

We start with some initial parameter value θold, and in the ﬁrst E step we evaluate the poste- rior distribution over latent variables, which gives rise to a lower bound L(θ, θ(old)) whose value equals the log likelihood at θ(old), as shown by the blue curve. Note that the bound makes a tangential contact with the log likelihood at θ(old), so that both curves have the same gradient. This bound is a convex function having a unique Exercise 9.25 maximum (for mixture components from the exponential family). In the M step, the bound is maximized giving the value θ(new), which gives a larger value of log likeli- hood than θ(old). The subsequent E step then constructs a bound that is tangential at θ(new) as shown by the green curve.

MIXTURE MODELS AND EM complete EM cycle will change the model parameters in such a way as to cause the log likelihood to increase (unless it is already at a maximum, in which case the parameters remain unchanged). We can also use the EM algorithm to maximize the posterior distribution p(θ|X) for models in which we have introduced a prior p(θ) over the parameters. To see this, we note that as a function of θ, we have p(θ|X) = p(θ, X)/p(X) and so ln p(θ|X) = ln p(θ, X) −ln p(X). (9.76) Making use of the decomposition (9.70), we have ln p(θ|X) = L(q, θ) + KL(q∥p) + ln p(θ) −ln p(X) ⩾ L(q, θ) + ln p(θ) −ln p(X). (9.77) where ln p(X) is a constant. We can again optimize the right-hand side alternately with respect to q and θ. The optimization with respect to q gives rise to the same E- step equations as for the standard EM algorithm, because q only appears in L(q, θ). The M-step equations are modiﬁed through the introduction of the prior term ln p(θ), which typically requires only a small modiﬁcation to the standard maximum likeli- hood M-step equations. The EM algorithm breaks down the potentially difﬁcult problem of maximizing the likelihood function into two stages, the E step and the M step, each of which will often prove simpler to implement. Nevertheless, for complex models it may be the case that either the E step or the M step, or indeed both, remain intractable.',\n",

       "  'sentence_chunk': 'Nevertheless, for complex models it may be the case that either the E step or the M step, or indeed both, remain intractable. This leads to two possible extensions of the EM algorithm, as follows. The generalized EM, or GEM, algorithm addresses the problem of an intractable M step. Instead of aiming to maximize L(q, θ) with respect to θ, it seeks instead to change the parameters in such a way as to increase its value. Again, because L(q, θ) is a lower bound on the log likelihood function, each complete EM cycle of the GEM algorithm is guaranteed to increase the value of the log likelihood (unless the parameters already correspond to a local maximum). One way to exploit the GEM approach would be to use one of the nonlinear optimization strategies, such as the conjugate gradients algorithm, during the M step. Another form of GEM algorithm, known as the expectation conditional maximization, or ECM, algorithm, involves making several constrained optimizations within each M step (Meng and Rubin, 1993). For instance, the parameters might be partitioned into groups, and the M step is broken down into multiple steps each of which involves optimizing one of the subset with the remainder held ﬁxed. We can similarly generalize the E step of the EM algorithm by performing a partial, rather than complete, optimization of L(q, θ) with respect to q(Z) (Neal and Hinton, 1999). As we have seen, for any given value of θ there is a unique maximum of L(q, θ) with respect to q(Z) that corresponds to the posterior distribution qθ(Z) = p(Z|X, θ) and that for this choice of q(Z) the bound L(q, θ) is equal to the log likelihood function ln p(X|θ). It follows that any algorithm that converges to the global maximum of L(q, θ) will ﬁnd a value of θ that is also a global maximum of the log likelihood ln p(X|θ).',\n",

Consider the case of N independent data points x1, . . . ,xN with corresponding latent variables z1, . . . ,zN. The joint distribution p(X, Z|θ) factorizes over the data points, and this structure can be exploited in an incremental form of EM in which at each EM cycle only one data point is processed at a time. In the E step, instead of recomputing the responsibilities for all of the data points, we just re-evaluate the responsibilities for one data point. It might appear that the subsequent M step would require computation involving the responsibilities for all of the data points. How- ever, if the mixture components are members of the exponential family, then the responsibilities enter only through simple sufﬁcient statistics, and these can be up- dated efﬁciently. Consider, for instance, the case of a Gaussian mixture, and suppose we perform an update for data point m in which the corresponding old and new values of the responsibilities are denoted γold(zmk) and γnew(zmk). In the M step, the required sufﬁcient statistics can be updated incrementally. For instance, for the means the sufﬁcient statistics are deﬁned by (9.17) and (9.18) from which we obtain Exercise 9.26 µnew k = µold k + \\x0fγnew(zmk) −γold(zmk) N new k \\x10 xm −µold k \\x0b (9.78) together with N new k = N old k + γnew(zmk) −γold(zmk).

The model might also contain some deterministic parameters, which we will leave implicit for the moment, or it may be a fully Bayesian model in which any unknown parameters are given prior distributions and are absorbed into the set of latent variables denoted by the vector Z. For instance, in the EM algorithm we need to evaluate the expectation of the complete-data log likelihood with respect to the posterior distribution of the latent variables. For many models of practical interest, it will be infeasible to evaluate the posterior distribution or indeed to compute expec- tations with respect to this distribution. This could be because the dimensionality of the latent space is too high to work with directly or because the posterior distribution has a highly complex form for which expectations are not analytically tractable.

For discrete variables, the marginal- izations involve summing over all possible conﬁgurations of the hidden variables, and though this is always possible in principle, we often ﬁnd in practice that there may be exponentially many hidden states so that exact calculation is prohibitively expensive. In such situations, we need to resort to approximation schemes, and these fall broadly into two classes, according to whether they rely on stochastic or determin- istic approximations. Stochastic techniques such as Markov chain Monte Carlo, de- scribed in Chapter 11, have enabled the widespread use of Bayesian methods across many domains. They generally have the property that given inﬁnite computational resource, they can generate exact results, and the approximation arises from the use of a ﬁnite amount of processor time. In practice, sampling methods can be compu- tationally demanding, often limiting their use to small-scale problems. Also, it can be difﬁcult to know whether a sampling scheme is generating independent samples from the required distribution. In this chapter, we introduce a range of deterministic approximation schemes, some of which scale well to large applications. These are based on analytical ap- proximations to the posterior distribution, for example by assuming that it factorizes in a particular way or that it has a speciﬁc parametric form such as a Gaussian. As such, they can never generate exact results, and so their strengths and weaknesses are complementary to those of sampling methods.',\n",

We conclude with a brief introduction to an alternative variational framework known as expectation propagation.10.1. Variational Inference Variational methods have their origins in the 18th century with the work of Euler, Lagrange, and others on the calculus of variations. Standard calculus is concerned with ﬁnding derivatives of functions. We can think of a function as a mapping that takes the value of a variable as the input and returns the value of the function as the output. The derivative of the function then describes how the output value varies as we make inﬁnitesimal changes to the input value. Similarly, we can deﬁne a functional as a mapping that takes a function as the input and that returns the value of the functional as the output. An example would be the entropy H[p], which takes a probability distribution p(x) as the input and returns the quantity H[p] = \\x06 p(x) ln p(x) dx (10.1)',\n",

We can the introduce the concept of a functional derivative, which ex- presses how the value of the functional changes in response to inﬁnitesimal changes to the input function (Feynman et al.,1964). The rules for the calculus of variations mirror those of standard calculus and are discussed in Appendix D. Many problems can be expressed in terms of an optimization problem in which the quantity being optimized is a functional. The solution is obtained by exploring all possible input functions to ﬁnd the one that maximizes, or minimizes, the functional. Variational methods have broad applicability and include such areas as ﬁnite element methods (Kapur, 1989) and maximum entropy (Schwarz, 1988). Although there is nothing intrinsically approximate about variational methods, they do naturally lend themselves to ﬁnding approximate solutions. This is done by restricting the range of functions over which the optimization is performed, for instance by considering only quadratic functions or by considering functions com- posed of a linear combination of ﬁxed basis functions in which only the coefﬁcients of the linear combination can vary. In the case of applications to probabilistic in- ference, the restriction may for example take the form of factorization assumptions (Jordan et al.,1999; Jaakkola, 2001).',\n",

       "  'sentence_chunk': '1999; Jaakkola, 2001). Now let us consider in more detail how the concept of variational optimization can be applied to the inference problem. Suppose we have a fully Bayesian model in which all parameters are given prior distributions. The model may also have latent variables as well as parameters, and we shall denote the set of all latent variables and parameters by Z. Similarly, we denote the set of all observed variables by X. For example, we might have a set of N independent, identically distributed data, for which X = {x1, . . . ,xN} and Z = {z1, . . . ,zN}. Our probabilistic model speciﬁes the joint distribution p(X, Z), and our goal is to ﬁnd an approximation for the posterior distribution p(Z|X) as well as for the model evidence p(X). As in our discussion of EM, we can decompose the log marginal probability using ln p(X) = L(q) + KL(q∥p) (10.2) where we have deﬁned L(q) = \\x06 q(Z) ln \\x0cp(X, Z) q(Z) \\r dZ (10.3) KL(q∥p) = − \\x06 q(Z) ln \\x0cp(Z|X) q(Z) \\r dZ. (10.4) This differs from our discussion of EM only in that the parameter vector θ no longer appears, because the parameters are now stochastic variables and are absorbed into Z. Since in this chapter we will mainly be interested in continuous variables we have used integrations rather than summations in formulating this decomposition. How- ever, the analysis goes through unchanged if some or all of the variables are discrete simply by replacing the integrations with summations as required. As before, we can maximize the lower bound L(q) by optimization with respect to the distribution q(Z), which is equivalent to minimizing the KL divergence. If we allow any possible choice for q(Z), then the maximum of the lower bound occurs when the KL diver- gence vanishes, which occurs when q(Z) equals the posterior distribution p(Z|X).',\n",

The left-hand plot shows the original distribution (yellow) along with the Laplace (red) and variational (green) approx- imations, and the right-hand plot shows the negative logarithms of the corresponding curves. However, we shall suppose the model is such that working with the true posterior distribution is intractable. We therefore consider instead a restricted family of distributions q(Z) and then seek the member of this family for which the KL divergence is minimized. Our goal is to restrict the family sufﬁciently that they comprise only tractable distributions, while at the same time allowing the family to be sufﬁciently rich and ﬂexible that it can provide a good approximation to the true posterior distribution. It is important to emphasize that the restriction is imposed purely to achieve tractability, and that sub- ject to this requirement we should use as rich a family of approximating distributions as possible. In particular, there is no ‘over-ﬁtting’ associated with highly ﬂexible dis- tributions. Using more ﬂexible approximations simply allows us to approach the true posterior distribution more closely. One way to restrict the family of approximating distributions is to use a paramet- ric distribution q(Z|ω) governed by a set of parameters ω. The lower bound L(q) then becomes a function of ω, and we can exploit standard nonlinear optimization techniques to determine the optimal values for the parameters.',\n",

In particular, we place no restriction on the functional forms of the individual factors qi(Zi). This factorized form of variational inference corresponds to an ap- proximation framework developed in physics called mean ﬁeld theory (Parisi, 1988). Amongst all distributions q(Z) having the form (10.5), we now seek that distri- bution for which the lower bound L(q) is largest. We therefore wish to make a free form (variational) optimization of L(q) with respect to all of the distributions qi(Zi), which we do by optimizing with respect to each of the factors in turn. To achieve this, we ﬁrst substitute (10.5) into (10.3) and then dissect out the dependence on one of the factors qj(Zj). Denoting qj(Zj) by simply qj to keep the notation uncluttered, we then obtain L(q) = \\x06 \\x0e i qi \\x18 ln p(X, Z) − \\x02 i ln qi \\x19 dZ = \\x06 qj \\x18\\x06 ln p(X, Z) \\x0e i̸=j qi dZi \\x19 dZj − \\x06 qj ln qj dZj + const = \\x06 qj ln\\x04p(X, Zj) dZj − \\x06 qj ln qj dZj + const (10.6) where we have deﬁned a new distribution \\x04p(X, Zj) by the relation ln\\x04p(X, Zj) = Ei̸=j[ln p(X, Z)] + const.

Thus we obtain a general expression for the optimal solution q⋆ j (Zj) given by ln q⋆ j (Zj) = Ei̸=j[ln p(X, Z)] + const. (10.9) It is worth taking a few moments to study the form of this solution as it provides the basis for applications of variational methods. It says that the log of the optimal so- lution for factor qj is obtained simply by considering the log of the joint distribution over all hidden and visible variables and then taking the expectation with respect to all of the other factors {qi} for i ̸= j. The additive constant in (10.9) is set by normalizing the distribution q⋆ j (Zj). Thus if we take the exponential of both sides and normalize, we have q⋆ j (Zj) = exp (Ei̸=j[ln p(X, Z)]) \\x06 exp (Ei̸=j[ln p(X, Z)]) dZj . In practice, we shall ﬁnd it more convenient to work with the form (10.9) and then re- instate the normalization constant (where required) by inspection. This will become clear from subsequent examples. The set of equations given by (10.9) for j = 1, . . . ,M represent a set of con- sistency conditions for the maximum of the lower bound subject to the factorization constraint. However, they do not represent an explicit solution because the expres- sion on the right-hand side of (10.9) for the optimum q⋆ j (Zj) depends on expectations computed with respect to the other factors qi(Zi) for i ̸= j. We will therefore seek a consistent solution by ﬁrst initializing all of the factors qi(Zi) appropriately and then cycling through the factors and replacing each in turn with a revised estimate given by the right-hand side of (10.9) evaluated using the current estimates for all of the other factors.',\n",

Let us consider for a moment the problem of approx- imating a general distribution by a factorized distribution. To begin with, we discuss the problem of approximating a Gaussian distribution using a factorized Gaussian, which will provide useful insight into the types of inaccuracy introduced in using factorized approximations. Consider a Gaussian distribution p(z) = N(z|µ, Λ−1) over two correlated variables z = (z1, z2) in which the mean and precision have elements µ = \\x0f µ1 µ2 \\x10 , Λ = \\x0f Λ11 Λ12 Λ21 Λ22 \\x10 (10.10) and Λ21 = Λ12 due to the symmetry of the precision matrix. Now suppose we wish to approximate this distribution using a factorized Gaussian of the form q(z) = q1(z1)q2(z2). We ﬁrst apply the general result (10.9) to ﬁnd an expression for the',\n",

In doing so it is useful to note that on the right-hand side we only need to retain those terms that have some functional dependence on z1 because all other terms can be absorbed into the normalization constant. Thus we have ln q⋆ 1(z1) = Ez2[ln p(z)] + const = Ez2 \\x1d −1 2(z1 −µ1)2Λ11 −(z1 −µ1)Λ12(z2 −µ2) \\x1e + const = −1 2z2 1Λ11 + z1µ1Λ11 −z1Λ12 (E[z2] −µ2) + const. (10.11) Next we observe that the right-hand side of this expression is a quadratic function of z1, and so we can identify q⋆(z1) as a Gaussian distribution. It is worth emphasizing that we did not assume that q(zi) is Gaussian, but rather we derived this result by variational optimization of the KL divergence over all possible distributions q(zi). Note also that we do not need to consider the additive constant in (10.9) explicitly because it represents the normalization constant that can be found at the end by inspection if required. Using the technique of completing the square, we can identify Section 2.3.1 the mean and precision of this Gaussian, giving q⋆(z1) = N(z1|m1, Λ−1 11 ) (10.12) where m1 = µ1 −Λ−1 11 Λ12 (E[z2] −µ2) . (10.13) By symmetry, q⋆ 2(z2) is also Gaussian and can be written as q⋆ 2(z2) = N(z2|m2, Λ−1 22 ) (10.14) in which m2 = µ2 −Λ−1 22 Λ21 (E[z1] −µ1) . (10.15) Note that these solutions are coupled, so that q⋆(z1) depends on expectations com- puted with respect to q⋆(z2) and vice versa. In general, we address this by treating the variational solutions as re-estimation equations and cycling through the variables in turn updating them until some convergence criterion is satisﬁed.',\n",

We shall see an example of this shortly. Here, however, we note that the problem is sufﬁciently simple that a closed form solution can be found. In particular, because E[z1] = m1 and E[z2] = m2, we see that the two equations are satisﬁed if we take E[z1] = µ1 and E[z2] = µ2, and it is easily shown that this is the only solution provided the dis- tribution is nonsingular. This result is illustrated in Figure 10.2(a). We see that the Exercise 10.2 mean is correctly captured but that the variance of q(z) is controlled by the direction of smallest variance of p(z), and that the variance along the orthogonal direction is signiﬁcantly under-estimated. It is a general result that a factorized variational ap- proximation tends to give approximations to the posterior distribution that are too compact.

The green contours corresponding to 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations for a correlated Gaussian distribution p(z) over two variables z1 and z2, and the red contours represent the corresponding levels for an approximating distribution q(z) over the same variables given by the product of two independent univariate Gaussian distributions whose parameters are obtained by minimization of (a) the Kullback- Leibler divergence KL(q∥p), and (b) the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence KL(p∥q).z1 z2 (a) 0 0.5 1 0 0.5 1 z1 z2 (b) 0 0.5 1 0 0.5 1 is used in an alternative approximate inference framework called expectation prop- agation.

The KL divergence can then be written in the form KL(p∥q) = − \\x06 p(Z) \\x1f M \\x02 i=1 ln qi(Zi)  dZ + const (10.16) where the constant term is simply the entropy of p(Z) and so does not depend on q(Z).

(10.17) In this case, we ﬁnd that the optimal solution for qj(Zj) is just given by the corre- sponding marginal distribution of p(Z). Note that this is a closed-form solution and so does not require iteration. To apply this result to the illustrative example of a Gaussian distribution p(z) over a vector z we can use (2.98), which gives the result shown in Figure 10.2(b).

We can gain further insight into the different behaviour of the two KL diver- gences if we consider approximating a multimodal distribution by a unimodal one, as illustrated in Figure 10.3. In practical applications, the true posterior distri- bution will often be multimodal, with most of the posterior mass concentrated in some number of relatively small regions of parameter space.

Suppose p(x) is a ﬁxed distribution, and we minimize Dα(p∥q) with respect to some set of distributions q(x). Then for α ⩽−1 the divergence is zero forcing, so that any values of x for which p(x) = 0 will have q(x) = 0, and typically q(x) will under-estimate the support of p(x) and will tend to seek the mode with the largest mass. Conversely for α ⩾1 the divergence is zero-avoiding, so that values of x for which p(x) > 0 will have q(x) > 0, and typically q(x) will stretch to cover all of p(x), and will over-estimate the support of p(x).

Section 1.2.4 10.1.4 Model comparison As well as performing inference over the hidden variables Z, we may also wish to compare a set of candidate models, labelled by the index m, and having prior probabilities p(m). Our goal is then to approximate the posterior probabilities p(m|X), where X is the observed data. This is a slightly more complex situation than that considered so far because different models may have different structure and indeed different dimensionality for the hidden variables Z. We cannot there- fore simply consider a factorized approximation q(Z)q(m), but must instead recog- nize that the posterior over Z must be conditioned on m, and so we must consider q(Z, m) = q(Z|m)q(m). We can readily verify the following decomposition based on this variational distribution Exercise 10.10 ln p(X) = Lm − \\x02 m \\x02 Z q(Z|m)q(m) ln \\x0c p(Z, m|X) q(Z|m)q(m) \\r (10.34) where the Lm is a lower bound on ln p(X) and is given by Lm = \\x02 m \\x02 Z q(Z|m)q(m) ln \\x0c p(Z, X, m) q(Z|m)q(m) \\r . (10.35) Here we are assuming discrete Z, but the same analysis applies to continuous latent variables provided the summations are replaced with integrations. We can maximize Lm with respect to the distribution q(m) using a Lagrange multiplier, with the result Exercise 10.11 q(m) ∝p(m) exp{Lm}. (10.36) However, if we maximize Lm with respect to the q(Z|m), we ﬁnd that the solutions for different m are coupled, as we expect because they are conditioned on m. We proceed instead by ﬁrst optimizing each of the q(Z|m) individually by optimization',\n",

Illustration: Variational Mixture of Gaussians We now return to our discussion of the Gaussian mixture model and apply the vari- ational inference machinery developed in the previous section. This will provide a good illustration of the application of variational methods and will also demonstrate how a Bayesian treatment elegantly resolves many of the difﬁculties associated with the maximum likelihood approach (Attias, 1999b). The reader is encouraged to work through this example in detail as it provides many insights into the practical appli- cation of variational methods. Many Bayesian models, corresponding to much more sophisticated distributions, can be solved by straightforward extensions and general- izations of this analysis. Our starting point is the likelihood function for the Gaussian mixture model, il- lustrated by the graphical model in Figure 9.6. For each observation xn we have a corresponding latent variable zn comprising a 1-of-K binary vector with ele- ments znk for k = 1, . . . ,K.

Note that we are working in terms of precision matrices rather than covariance matrices as this somewhat simpliﬁes the mathemat- ics. Next we introduce priors over the parameters µ, Λ and π. The analysis is con- siderably simpliﬁed if we use conjugate prior distributions. We therefore choose a Section 10.4.1 Dirichlet distribution over the mixing coefﬁcients π p(π) = Dir(π|α0) = C(α0) K \\x0e k=1 πα0−1 k (10.39) where by symmetry we have chosen the same parameter α0 for each of the compo- nents, and C(α0) is the normalization constant for the Dirichlet distribution deﬁned',\n",

As we have seen, the parameter α0 can be interpreted as the effective Section 2.2.1 prior number of observations associated with each component of the mixture. If the value of α0 is small, then the posterior distribution will be inﬂuenced primarily by the data rather than by the prior.

Lines denote the decision boundaries, and the background colours denote the respective classes of the decision regions. On the left is the result of using a least-squares discriminant. We see that the region of input space assigned to the green class is too small and so most of the points from this class are misclassiﬁed. On the right is the result of using logistic regressions as described in Section 4.3.2 showing correct classiﬁcation of the training data.dimensional input vector x and project it down to one dimension using y = wTx. (4.20) If we place a threshold on y and classify y ⩾−w0 as class C1, and otherwise class C2, then we obtain our standard linear classiﬁer discussed in the previous section. In general, the projection onto one dimension leads to a considerable loss of infor- mation, and classes that are well separated in the original D-dimensional space may become strongly overlapping in one dimension. However, by adjusting the com- ponents of the weight vector w, we can select a projection that maximizes the class separation. To begin with, consider a two-class problem in which there are N1 points of class C1 and N2 points of class C2, so that the mean vectors of the two classes are given by m1 = 1 N1 \\x02 n ∈C1 xn, m2 = 1 N2 \\x02 n ∈C2 xn.

       "'Ridge RegressionRidge regression (also called Tikhonov regularization) is a regularizedversion of linear regression: a regularization term equal to αm∑i=1nθi2 isadded to the MSE. This forces the learning algorithm to not only fit the databut also keep the model weights as small as possible. Note that theregularization term should only be added to the cost function during training. Once the model is trained, you want to use the unregularized MSE (or theRMSE) to evaluate the model’s performance. The hyperparameter α controls how much you want to regularize the model. If α = 0, then ridge regression is just linear regression. If α is very large, thenall weights end up very close to zero and the result is a flat line going throughthe data’s mean. Equation 4-8 presents the ridge regression cost function.\\u2060Equation 4-8. Ridge regression cost functionJ(θ)=MSE(θ)+αm∑i=1nθi2Note that the bias term θ is not regularized (the sum starts at i = 1, not 0). Ifwe define w as the vector of feature weights (θ to θ ), then the regularizationterm is equal to α(∥ w ∥) / m, where ∥ w ∥ represents the ℓ norm ofthe weight vector.\\u2060 For batch gradient descent, just add 2αw / m to the partof the MSE gradient vector that corresponds to the feature weights, withoutadding anything to the gradient of the bias term (see Equation 4-6). WARNINGIt is important to scale the data (e.g., using a StandardScaler) before performing ridgeregression, as it is sensitive to the scale of the input features. This is true of mostregularized models.'"

Ridge is a good default, but if you suspect that only a fewfeatures are useful, you should prefer lasso or elastic net because they tend toreduce the useless features’ weights down to zero, as discussed earlier. Ingeneral, elastic net is preferred over lasso because lasso may behaveerratically when the number of features is greater than the number of traininginstances or when several features are strongly correlated.

      "Ridge Regression, also known as Ridge regularization, is a statistical method used to perform linear regression analysis. It's an extension of ordinary least squares (OLS) that adds a penalty term to the cost function during optimization. This penalty term helps prevent overfitting by adding some \"regularization\" and making it less likely for coefficients to become too large in magnitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's how it works:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. The Problem:** \n",
      "   - Linear regression aims to find the best fit line or curve through data points using parameters like slope and intercept.  \n",
      "   - However, with complex datasets containing many variables, these models can be prone to high variance and overly sensitive to noise.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Introducing Regularization:**\n",
      "    - **Regularization**: Instead of just minimizing error directly, we add a penalty term proportional to the square of the coefficient values. This prevents extreme parameter estimates from being pushed towards zero due to small fluctuations in training data.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. How it Works:**\n",
      "     * We modify the standard OLS loss function by incorporating this added penalty term into our calculations.\n",
      "     * A common form of regularized loss functions uses the following formula: `Loss = Loss(β) + λ * ||β||²` where β represents all model parameters. Here, 'λ' is called the regularization strength which controls the amount of smoothing applied. Higher lambda leads to more smoothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Optimization Process:**\n",
      "      * During optimization, instead of simply aiming at minimal residual sum of squares (RSS), we aim to minimize both RSS and the penalized terms simultaneously.\n",
      "      * Algorithms are then adjusted to balance finding optimal weights while avoiding excessively large coefficients.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. Benefits of Ridge Regression:**\n",
      "   - **Reduces Overfitting:** By penalizing larger coefficients, Ridge Regression reduces the likelihood of excessive complexity leading to better generalization on unseen data.\n",
      "   - **Handles High Dimensionality:** Useful when dealing with numerous features because it avoids issues associated with multicollinearity.\n",
      "   - **Interpretability:** Smaller coefficients indicate smaller impact of individual predictors, offering insights about their relative importance.\n",
      "\n",
      "**6. Applications:**\n",
      "   - Financial modeling\n",
      "   - Medical research\n",
      "   - Image processing\n",
      "   - Natural language processing\n",
